not counting him being taken away in handcuffs after getting burned for michael 's actions	1	action crime drama

guilty as charged michael sam and fiona who are trying to clear jesse 's name and bring down barrett versus jesse who wants revenge against michael for burning him versus vaughn who thinks michael 's on his side and wants to eliminate jesse versus barrett who is a merchant of death with his hands in michael and jesse 's burn notices	1	action crime drama
pops up in season 4 episode breach of faith while michael was doing the best he could with what he had his entire escape plan could 've been utterly derailed by only one of any number of variables such as the incriminating cash not being in a safe right in the building they were in the safe in question not being a floor safe and thus having weak sides the swat team trying and successfully getting audio and/or visual feeds inside the office the villain of the week not having a gun pointed at team westen and friends as the swat team breached the office or the villain of the week 's assistant not finiding her conscience and turning against her former boss	1	action crime drama
he in narration is fully aware of how lucky he is	1	action crime drama
arguably the finale of season 2/the beginning of season 3 handwaves the fridge logic of why does n't michael get the cops on him for doing crazy stuff constantly and why do n't more of his old enemies show up by saying the management was working some magic to keep him off the radar the moment he returns from meeting with them he is set on by the police and his bail is paid by someone else who 's now able to locate him	1	action crime drama

in eyes open jesse blows up fiona 's house with a bomber in it to both save michael 's life and keep the bomber from ever killing anyone else even though the team had been willing to let the guy be taken in by the police and/or otherwise be taken of in less ruthless fashion	1	action crime drama

jesse knew exactly what michael was implying and was noticeably distraught over it	1	action crime drama
in the season 3 finale management grabs onto it with both hands landing his helicopter on what he knows to be the only helipad in the area when he also knows that a revenge-hungry psychotic killer ex-agent has had ample opportunity to set up an ambush	1	action crime drama
the fact that this comes out right before an i 'm tougher than i look speech only serves to heighten the effect	1	action crime drama
agent bly grabs the ball firmly in bad breaks attempting to wrestle away a bank robber 's gun while the rest of the criminals are within ear and eyeshot	1	action crime drama

michael poses as one to befriend a psychotically-unstable bomber no not fiona in eyes open	0	action crime drama
they get out of the alleyway unhurt	0	action crime drama
it is only something to get the characters involved and add a sense of i do n't know what they 're trying to do but we have to stop them	0	action crime drama
rather fitting for the guy that 's setting up to be the bigger bad of the entire series	1	action crime drama
played with in 4x07 where fi and michael ask why jesse is staring intensely at an old overweight woman in a bikini	0	action crime drama
in devil you know maddie slaps an fbi agent for trying to convince her that michael 's a contract killer	1	action crime drama

4x01 has one between michael and three bikers while 4x02 has one between two asian gangsters	1	action crime drama
it 's a kind of spicy goat cheese	0	action crime drama
notice that the newspaper article in damned if you do said two dead which means that only the two guards have been confirmed dead	1	action crime drama
which means that not quite dead larry is out there somewhere and he 's even more pissed off	1	action crime drama
turn your back on the protection management offered then shoot strickler then break a psychotic killer out of prison	1	action crime drama
the last one is immediately lampshaded by sam	1	action crime drama

formerly cheerly and nice jesse as of eyes open is a heck of a lot darker angrier and perhaps even much more willing to cross certain moral lines	1	action crime drama

he realized that if he kept the merchandise both the government and the black market would be looking for him	0	action crime drama
the only surprise was just how far it went setting up fiona to be killed because associating with someone like her was bad for michael 's image	0	action crime drama
sam 's onstar-equipped cadillac for season one later taken back by the gal who gave it to him and in the first episode of season 2 a client gives michael a saab which he passed on to fiona	0	action crime drama

in the end brennen is dead and as a result michael 's hours away from winding up on management 's hit list	1	action crime drama
the previously on burn notice recap at the beginning of the season 3 finale shows clips of management from the end of season 2 thus spoiling the surprise when after an entire season of not being mentioned at all management suddenly pops up again later in the episode	1	action crime drama
the name mike takes for his persona is homer	0	action crime drama
the addition of jesse as a regular also seems to have allowed the show to contain more of these non-formula stories by allowing team westen to break up into two teams of two rather than having one solo character trying to solve problems	0	action crime drama
to rescue his daughter westen and crew request that the attorney get them a one-man submarine from the cartel	0	action crime drama

at the end of the episode jesse detonates the bomb the bomb-maker is carrying killing him and destroying fiona 's house	1	action crime drama
keep in mind this is in a series where the protagonists rarely if ever actually kill anyone	1	action crime drama

in this case it was a client story and jesse was directly responsible for the killing	1	action crime drama
michael really likes yogurt	0	action crime drama
fridge logic suggests this of larry of all people particularly given his line to michael they put us out there they tell us the end justifies the means sooner or later you believe 'em	0	action crime drama
then of course he found out who really got him burned	0	action crime drama
then in the last scene he opens his eyes to find he 's seated not in some secret prison but a well-furnished luxurious den	1	action crime drama
probably a very classy blacksite prison for people they want to have less incentive to escape	1	action crime drama
the cleaner in the teaser of friends like these does the uf bit	0	action crime drama

he takes this about as well as you would expect	1	action crime drama
the organization that hired simon and which jesse was investigating before he got burned	1	action crime drama
i 'll take my chances	1	action crime drama
in this case fans had to wait until the next season to see if the change of direction was going to really mean anything	1	action crime drama
to start with michael is on the run from the fbi and dhs after helping simon escape	1	action crime drama
after a whole lot of indy ploying by everyone involved simon 's on his way back to some secret prison ... and michael 's been disappeared off to some unknown location presumably to go to work for management	1	action crime drama

however sam who obtained the flight plans from a friend refuses to let michael take them stating that he would be putting thousands of people at risk as well as exposing his source	1	action crime drama
fortunately michael decides that even though gilroy might kill him for not providing all of the flight plans he would n't want to live with himself if he put all those people in danger anyway	1	action crime drama

subverted hard in friends like these	0	action crime drama
in the season 4 finale with brennan and dead larry working together the only question is who will turn on the other first	1	action crime drama
quite a few clients have dead family members or close friends as incentive to bring the bad guy to justice	0	action crime drama
the thing is michael did not have any fond memories of his dad but the invasion against his family was still intensely personal	1	action crime drama
michael never quite says it but his last interactions with joey in shot in the dark are all about this including when they both lean on michael 's car the exact same way and in the same pose	0	action crime drama
reinforced for humor michael says that the hypothetical guy who used to be a street punk got a better job doing a lot of the things he did when he was young	0	action crime drama

arthur guesses that merlin was the one who placed the sword of mars in the stone ... despite that event having taken place several hundred if not thousand years before the romans arrived in britain since the sword was already there when they showed up	1	drama fantasy

merlin could have just planted it in peoples minds using magic and/or his own wiles	1	drama fantasy
however igraine and morgan definitely state that he has n't aged for a long time	1	drama fantasy
besides the usual spelling choices with arthurian works this show 's version of morgan le fay is called morgan pendragon and like bbc 's merlin which has morgana pendragon unlike the traditional legends where she 's not uther pendragon 's daughter	0	drama fantasy

they made their onscreen debut in series 6 with a convoluted and almost-successful assassination attempt on the doctor and all indications are that they 'll be back in future series of the moffat era	1	adventure drama family
any number of critters not least of which is the doctor himself he can do things like regenerate re-grow hands and absorb radiation transform it into a form harmless to humans and expel it through his foot	0	adventure drama family

steven moffat loves to make numerous references both in dialogue and in the background to past on-screen adventures	0	adventure drama family
pretty much every time the doctor is n't present or is n't really invested in their enemy surviving aka when daleks fight the cybermen both were enemies and if either survived the survivor would take over the world the result is that the daleks pretty much curb stomp their opponent with the only real exception being the time lords themselves who were still losing	1	adventure drama family
the cybermen lose easily and let 's not forget that it took minutes for them to subdue earth in spite of tremendous preparations specifically for this eventuality	1	adventure drama family

the show does n't even bother to explain why his possessed trakenite body is alive again in mark of the rani after burning to death in planet of fire	1	adventure drama family
naturally this meant steven moffat had to go and dig them up again but he 's been careful to keep them alive since	0	adventure drama family
since steven moffat took over the show things have only gotten bleaker at an increasing rate and by the end of series 6 the doctor has practically lost all faith in himself and is basically a death seeker	0	adventure drama family
that last is less egregious of an error in early episodes when the name distinction was n't firmly established yet	0	adventure drama family
it 's been asked an ungodly number of times and as of series 6 it 's the oldest question in the universe hidden in plain sight and must never ever be answered	1	adventure drama family

basically rory has killed amy and the tardis explodes with river inside erasing the universe from existence whilst the doctor is being locked inside the greatest prison ever constructed by all of his enemies	1	adventure drama family

usually the doctor and his companions survive but they have been known to depart from places where all known characters died or there might be minor survivors in the odd corners	0	adventure drama family

at the end of planet of the dead a low-level psychic tells him he 's going to die so he spends the next episodes running around having as many adventures possible before his inevitable regeneration	1	adventure drama family
it occurs more literally in the end of time after receiving a fatal dose of radiation the doctor spends his last hours visiting the people he 'd cared about during his tenth life and ... well not so much saying goodbye as helping them out from a distance and then staring sadly at them before wandering off	1	adventure drama family

and steven moffat has reportedly said that as a result of the cracks and what was necessary to fix them a number of major events of the preceding series most notably the several alien invasions and other incidents that attracted widespread public notice have been erased from history leaving an earth that is once again almost entirely ignorant of the existence of alien beings	1	adventure drama family

there 's an argument to be made that the entirety of the new series is essentially a sequel of sorts to genesis of the daleks as some have theorized that the time lords forcing the doctor to destroy the daleks was what essentially pulled the trigger on the time war in the first place resulting in the destruction of gallifrey among other things	0	adventure drama family

if its not love then its certainly ungentlemanly	1	mystery thriller
what do you mean you thought bloom genuinely was in love with adile and that all those longing looks between him and martha were simply due to the fact of her being there	1	mystery thriller

when barbara is busted down a rank in the series 3 premiere she is issued a uniform but is consistently referred to as d c havers	1	crime drama mystery
this is incorrect as dc means detective constable	1	crime drama mystery
detectives attached to cid or special branch wear plainclothes	1	crime drama mystery
if she was issued a uniform it would mean she was kicked out of cid yet the prefix detective indicates that she was not especially since she went back to plainclothes when she was reinstated in the third episode of that series	1	crime drama mystery
the likely explanation for this is that being busted back into a uniform packs more of an emotional punch	1	crime drama mystery
she could also probably qualify for the miss adorable contest	0	crime drama mystery
the one surefire way to make sure thomas lynley will hate you forever is to injure or threaten barbara havers	0	crime drama mystery
then he 's suspended for allegedly using excessive violence on a suspect	0	crime drama mystery
havers should have been kicked off the force years ago she was in fact on the verge of being sacked when she met thomas lynley and was even demoted once because she has no social skills and a hair-trigger temper	1	crime drama mystery
this is how lynley copes with helen 's death until barbara after six months of trying finally snaps him out of it in limbo	1	crime drama mystery
by the end of the pilot episode their plan backfired quite spectacularly ... and barbara and lynley only get closer from there	0	crime drama mystery
trigger in in divine proportion when barbara is held hostage at gunpoint	1	crime drama mystery
her flashback is to the previous series finale in which she was shot in the abdomen she shows obvious signs of ptsd throughout the episode and goes a little nuts at the end	1	crime drama mystery
it takes who else	1	crime drama mystery
lynley literally pulling her off the guy and administering a cooldown hug to bring her back to normal	1	crime drama mystery
lynley believes his feelings for helen were this	1	crime drama mystery
in the final episode of series 3 his wife is involved in a car accident that results in her miscarriage a hospital stay and their separation	1	crime drama mystery
as if that 's not bad enough days later his partner is shot in the line of duty resulting in yet another hospital stay months of recovery time and ptsd	1	crime drama mystery
which renders die for our ship unnecessary as it clears the way for lynley/havers in just about the most convenient manner possible	1	crime drama mystery
the first one noted lower down is you called me x it must be serious the other is when havers is staying with him at the family estate in cornwall	0	crime drama mystery
it really becomes apparent after the events of in divine proportion the next episode in particular in the guise of death is especially notable for this vibe	0	crime drama mystery
the only characters to not fall victim to this aside from their police superiors are helen who is killed off for real at the end of series 5 and their reconciliation likely would n't have lasted anyway their coworker dc winston nkata who first shows up in series 5 and the medical examiner stuart lafferty ditto	1	crime drama mystery
havers goes along	1	crime drama mystery
havers gets demoted	1	crime drama mystery
lynley calls her in on every case he can	1	crime drama mystery
let 's face it at the end of the day they just keep coming back to each other	1	crime drama mystery
whether the substance inside is coffee or tea however is anybody 's guess	0	crime drama mystery
one of the most notable comes when lynley realises that barbara is trapped inside a pub at gunpoint and that this is going to trigger her like nothing else	1	crime drama mystery
the only thing that stops him from going in on the spot is an armed assault team holding him back	1	crime drama mystery
havers one tug on the old school tie and you come running	0	crime drama mystery
notably it takes an armed assault team to keep him from bursting into the pub where barbara is being held hostage at gunpoint in in divine proportion	1	crime drama mystery
she then goes on to note that lynley is already in love with helen clyde who dies at the end of series 5	1	crime drama mystery
considering that shippers have looked past blood relationships death little-to-no interaction and not even being from the same universe this is hardly proof positive that nothing will ever happen and in fact they are given an open ending with all romantic competition out of the way and seven years of added depth to their relationship	1	crime drama mystery
in light of all this the denial is not particularly convincing	1	crime drama mystery
when barbara is demoted at the beginning of series 2 lynley plays this trope to the hilt to keep her with him and calls her in on every case he possibly can even though she 's not technically under his supervision any more	1	crime drama mystery
when forced to justify this to his supervisor he tells said supervisor that he 's calling her in because she 's proven that she can work with him effectively	1	crime drama mystery
this is absolutely true and has absolutely nothing to do with why he wants her around	1	crime drama mystery
implied to be the main cause of lynley 's heroic bsod following helen 's death as she was shot right in front of him because of a case he was working	1	crime drama mystery
she 's a cranky foul-mouthed working-class junk food addict with massive class resentment issues	0	crime drama mystery
and let 's not forget the last two scenes of in divine proportion in which barbara is held hostage at gunpoint on her first case back from getting shot	1	crime drama mystery
the way he holds her close and soothes her is ... a bit more than friendly	0	crime drama mystery
especially that kiss he presses to the top of her head ... special mention also goes to the shower scene in one guilty deed when they dance around each other in tight quarters while she 's in pyjamas and he 's in a towel	1	crime drama mystery
and word of god where he breaks off a date shows up at barbara 's flat in the middle of the night and questions whether or not he ever truly loved helen	1	crime drama mystery
immediately after this they admit that they are each others reason to get up in the morning i 'm sorry was this supposed to be subtext	1	crime drama mystery
series 2 had the events in the north sea that led to barbara 's demotion series 3 had helen 's miscarriage and barbara being shot series 4 had lynley 's suspension and series 5 had helen 's death	1	crime drama mystery
series 6 did n't follow this pattern but that was because the show was cancelled before the third and fourth episodes of the series could be completed	1	crime drama mystery
suffice it to say that when lynley calls havers barbara it 's either a crowning moment of heartwarming or a massive massive tear jerker like when havers gets shot at which point lynley loses it quite spectacularly and can only say barbara	1	crime drama mystery

the normally perceptive luther assumes that his long-time friend ian reed is turning vigilante man	1	crime drama mystery
he 's actually a corrupt cop trying desperately to cover his tracks	1	crime drama mystery

also marks the beginning of their foe yay	1	crime drama mystery
the death of his wife zoe is responsible for much of luther 's angst in the second series	1	crime drama mystery

we know that alice is not a very nice person when she puts a round in both her parents heads	0	crime drama mystery
ian reed pretends to be a dirty cop to get to a ritual killer for the protagonist	0	crime drama mystery
alice puts in a single contact lens when carrying out her sickbed slaying presumably so the police officer she speaks face-to-face with will remember this unusual detail rather than her actual features	0	crime drama mystery
in episode three he goes to her as a sounding board regarding the case of the week and in episode six she gives luther shelter and aid while he is on the run for the framed murder of zoe	1	crime drama mystery
luther has to disguise himself to steal the gun reed planted on the crime scene	1	crime drama mystery
alice points out that as a huge scary black man he 's difficult to disguise	1	crime drama mystery
he 's also more willing to accept that there are holes in the theory that luther killed zoe than teller	1	crime drama mystery
she 's behind luther 's back but if necessary she will put him in his place if there is need	1	crime drama mystery
mark north is originally set up as this but it 's ultimately a subversion as the love triangle is rendered irrelevant after zoe 's death	1	crime drama mystery
eventually owen is down to the last chamber and it 's his turn luther decks him when he puts the gun to his head to commit suicide	1	crime drama mystery
of course this may have been a result of alice cheerfully informing him of his other options with a bright cheery smile on her face	1	crime drama mystery
the fact that he means it may be one of the reasons alice likes him so much	1	crime drama mystery
in episode three luther finds himself up against a smug snake and complete monster of a man named lucian burgess who enjoys psychological torture and bleeding his victims dry	1	crime drama mystery
he goes and visits another completemonster he knows and over a friendly conversation alice gives him the idea to change the playing field	1	crime drama mystery
so he beats lucian bloody and uses the blood from the assault to trick lucian into running to the crime scene	1	crime drama mystery
notably subverted when reed pretends to be suffering this to lure luther into a trap fortunately luther knows what he 's up to	1	crime drama mystery
probably the best example is when on the advice of alice luther deliberately engineers this in lucian burgess	1	crime drama mystery
making one think it may have been his plan to set her off on madsen all along	1	crime drama mystery
after luther refuses to let him commit suicide by cop reed pulls a knife and stabs luther then kicks him along the ground screaming now look what you 're making me do	1	crime drama mystery

very very strongly averted when nimue is disfigured with an enormous scar across her face that can not be healed after narrowly escaping a dragon	1	adventure drama fantasy
when asked why she did n't kill him she responds because that 's what he wanted me to do this backfires on her though	1	adventure drama fantasy

merlin gets an epic rant against mab after the deaths of his mother and ambrosia and the scarring of nimue and then again right after arthur is born	1	adventure drama fantasy
though he 's addressing mab the feel of both scenes on the beach with the tide coming in the first time and on a rocky bluff in the middle of a rainstorm the second time seems to specifically invoke this	1	adventure drama fantasy
of course given that mab is a fey goddess and merlin very much hopes to destroy her religion and utterly erase her from existence it 's pretty literal as well	1	adventure drama fantasy
vortigern 's forces as he takes over england	0	adventure drama fantasy
unless merlin conveniently left out the part where he got his head chopped off and died i do n't think even that can make merlin 's apprentice fit continuity	1	adventure drama fantasy

in aithusa when gaius power hungry and traitorous former pupil scoffs at merlin 's assertion that the dragon 's egg should not be used as a tool merlin comes up with this gem just before he blasts him into a wall	1	adventure drama fantasy
with only three exceptions gwen freya and elena every single beautiful woman on the show ends up being a villain or is at least meant to be percieved as unsympathetic	1	adventure drama fantasy
you 'd think they would have made her as unpleasant as possible so arthur would come and throw himself at gwen again but she 's actually rather nice	0	adventure drama fantasy

he even seems to be a member of the council and is the one who backs up guinevere in the darkest hour	0	adventure drama fantasy
however the villains trying to kill him morgana and morgause have some evil tendencies in a well-intentioned extremist way	1	adventure drama fantasy
they will kill others but only if they have to to get to uther or arthur later	1	adventure drama fantasy
in both the opening and the closing two-parters of series 3 camelot was attacked by an army of immortal soldiers sent by morgause and cenred	0	adventure drama fantasy
arthur is crowned king at the beginning of series 4 guinevere is crowned queen at its conclusion	1	adventure drama fantasy
in the third case it 's by merlin	1	adventure drama fantasy
3x03 goblins gold which comes after the dramatic two-part series opener where morgana returns and camelot is nearly destroyed	0	adventure drama fantasy
but since he ca n't use his magic in public it was a pretty futile threat and merlin just ends up getting his ass kicked	0	adventure drama fantasy
in the pilot episode merlin says of arthur i said you were a prat i just did n't know you were a royal one	0	adventure drama fantasy
surprisingly arthur finally catches on to this in the season 4 finale	0	adventure drama fantasy
so ... how will he react when he discovers merlin has magic	1	adventure drama fantasy
also obviously morgana due due to her powers as a seer which ultimatly are often ignored especially by arthur who frequently dismisses them as nightmares or taking it as a sign of romantic attraction that she dreams about him this is entirely shippers choice although it does seem to be rather obvious in season 1	1	adventure drama fantasy
this is subverted by the fact that gauis and merlin often use these dreams to their own advantage to help merlin protect arthur-often without telling her and again almost always attempting to brush it off as just a dream	1	adventure drama fantasy
as of 3x07 she 's regaining her reputation as a badass normal fending off an intruder with a poker joining the men on their rescue mission lighting a fire when arthur can not whilst still remaining within the boundaries of what a slight young woman would realistically be capable of	1	adventure drama fantasy
and make bandages for the series finale	0	adventure drama fantasy
when arthur is trying to draw excalibur merlin says that he needs to truly believe he can in order to do it	1	adventure drama fantasy

arthur and merlin wear red and blue	0	adventure drama fantasy
in series 3 she has another one which could indicate her intentions to get the throne	0	adventure drama fantasy
in the wicked day arthur is aware that the death of his mother was the result of magic despite having been convinced otherwise in sins of the father	1	adventure drama fantasy
however nothing yet compares with the sight of guinevere 's coronation gown	1	adventure drama fantasy
his first instinct is to try and kill the guy who had been one of his most loyal knights and had shown him mercy in the tournament earlier	1	adventure drama fantasy
and then by the end of the episode he banishes gwen from camelot	1	adventure drama fantasy
kind of shocking coming from a guy who while brash is usually compassionate and understanding	1	adventure drama fantasy
it works out fairly well though because quite frankly no one wants to see dark age europe	0	adventure drama fantasy
merlin and morgana spend a lot of series three doing this to each other	1	adventure drama fantasy
most one shot characters were they villains of the week such as edwin sophia aulfric tauren sigan catrina jonas aredian grunhilda and more recently borden lamia and agravaine or victims of the week such as will freya balinor and the fisher king have died within the episode	1	adventure drama fantasy
morgana seems to be heading this way and then heads all the way back	1	adventure drama fantasy
morgana looks like she 's pretty much out for the count in the season four finale but the white dragon merlin hatched decides to drop by and heal her	1	adventure drama fantasy
most of the time the devil is someone rather easily gaining uther 's or arthur 's trust	0	adventure drama fantasy

while discussing a tournament arthur is about to compete in merlin keeps talking about how many people died the last time just on the first day	0	adventure drama fantasy
by series 4 merlin literally becomes the stuff of nightmares towards morgana	1	adventure drama fantasy
guess who appears in 3x01	1	adventure drama fantasy
though when you think about it there are quite a few explanations for the 'deaths of those knights it could merely be a dramatic subversion of early-bird cameo by in turn averting the one steve limit or the legends of arthur 's court be rather inaccurate or perhaps one or two of those knights could end up being ressurrected without turning evil later on	1	adventure drama fantasy

nimueh succeeds with one in the poisoned chalice with a plot to force merlin into drinking poison by switching arthur 's chalice with a poisoned one disguising herself as a serving girl and telling merlin that she witnessed the visiting lord of another kingdom spike the chalice that he presents to arthur as a gift	0	adventure drama fantasy
lancelot almost achieves this when he faces death with the knowledge that guinevere has escaped up until he realizes that she 's been recaptured	0	adventure drama fantasy
in 4x02 lancelot does it again when he sacrifices himself to close the veil	1	adventure drama fantasy
and then in 4x09 he does it again when merlin brings him back for a last moment before he dies for the second time this time probably for good	1	adventure drama fantasy
surprisingly avoided with merlin although any more conflicting loyalty episodes during series 3 might finally push him over the edge	1	adventure drama fantasy
there is focus on arthur and gwen 's hands when he helps her to her feet after crowning her queen of camelot	1	adventure drama fantasy
after enlisting the help of a sorcress in order for his barren wife to conceive he set about killing and terrorising everyone who practised sorcery even those who did so for perfectly innocent reasons even though he had no one to blame for his wife 's death except himself	1	adventure drama fantasy
you 'd think this act of blatant hypocrisy would make him decide to ease up on the sorcerers a bit from then on but you 'd be wrong ... later on in series 3 there was a sorcerer going around healing people miraculously who was gaius 's former lover	1	adventure drama fantasy
uther wanted gaius to see if sorcery was involved in the healings and it is implied he would have executed whoever did it	1	adventure drama fantasy
the fact that he was willing to use magic to miraculously heal morgana is made even more hypocritical because of that in retrospect	1	adventure drama fantasy
kill the ones you love shoot the dog merlin poisons morgana who was unsware that she was the vessel of the knights of medhir because he did what he had to do in order to save camelot but at the price of killing his friend and someone he cared about	1	adventure drama fantasy
many fans while praising the acting of colin and katie did not agree with merlin 's actions	1	adventure drama fantasy
arthur also gets a moment of this when his father starts dying	1	adventure drama fantasy
arthur responds by telling him that yes he would have to kill him if he divulged that information	0	adventure drama fantasy
and it finally happens in 4x03	1	adventure drama fantasy
morganas face heel turn could have been avoided if merlin had told her about his magic or at least treated her better	1	adventure drama fantasy
when merlin secretly helps morgana in 2x03 when she discovers that she is a seer arthur is under the belief that merlin is in love with morgana and warns him uther would have his head for it	1	adventure drama fantasy
a deleted scene for the shadow of the sorcerer reveals that the sash arthur was wearing around his arm in the melee came from morgana	0	adventure drama fantasy
and merlin in 2x13 when he becomes the last dragonlord	1	adventure drama fantasy
as of aithusa kilgarrah is no longer the last dragon	1	adventure drama fantasy
merlin brings freya to the lake so that she dies in a place similar to her home	1	adventure drama fantasy
according to bradley james the reason why they put a halt to arthur/morgana was to not get the impression of brother-sister incest since she is like his sister-in-law and because they wanted to start the arthur/gwen romance	0	adventure drama fantasy
they then proceed to each stand up and give a speech about why they refuse to leave arthur one by one until it reaches merlin who remains seated and jokes actually i do n't really fancy it	0	adventure drama fantasy
morgana 's strong attachment towards mordred causes her to become very protective of him and a willingness to do anything for him in order to keep him from harm 's way	0	adventure drama fantasy
and it was arthur who went for it no less	1	adventure drama fantasy
averted merlin does n't have it in this version	0	adventure drama fantasy
in 2x09 right before the bastet kills the couple and the guards we see the scene through its eyes	1	adventure drama fantasy
gaius is also morally ambiguous though by no means evil	1	adventure drama fantasy
he focuses on merlin 's safety to the point of denying help to other magicians who need it including mordred and morgana which brings him into conflict with merlin 's chronic hero syndrome	1	adventure drama fantasy
it 's also implied he betrayed nimueh and his other fellow magic-users to uther as a young man	0	adventure drama fantasy
bradley james arthur 's shirt collar becomes progressively more open with each episode	0	adventure drama fantasy
a good third of his admittedly quite nice chest is exposed	0	adventure drama fantasy
made all the worse because only the audience knows that she was under a spell the entire time and she actually believes that she willingly betrayed arthur even if she does n't understand why	1	adventure drama fantasy
in the promo pictures for 3x13 arthur was shown holding exacalibur something he never does in the episode itself	1	adventure drama fantasy
gwen even comments nice hat in between giggles	0	adventure drama fantasy
freeing the dragon is not merlin 's best idea ever	1	adventure drama fantasy
merlin 's treatment of morgana and mordred is a contributing cause of her face heel turn and his start of darkness	1	adventure drama fantasy
to some extent perhaps merlin trying to heal uther even though uther 's death is n't his fault merlin/dragoon 's price to gain peace for the magic-users may be lost	1	adventure drama fantasy
works to merlin 's benefit when lifting the dragon 's egg causes the tower in which it was hidden to collapse	1	adventure drama fantasy
uther might be a genocidal tyrant but he 's also a loving parent and a brave warrior who will put himself in harm 's way to protect his kingdom	0	adventure drama fantasy
while they usually do n't believe him they trust him enough to give him the benefit of the doubt	0	adventure drama fantasy
gwen i 'm that is not true	0	adventure drama fantasy
then he died when merlin finally met him	1	adventure drama fantasy
morgana views uther keeping the secret that he is her real father explicitly as this	1	adventure drama fantasy
plus it 's not like arthur hates or even dislikes her and like the prince would throw her out had he the chance	1	adventure drama fantasy
in short morgana is literally living like a princess and she is set for a life as such but she 's ready to kill her father because he wo n't jeopardize his position and hers as been pointed in the succession crisis entry below	1	adventure drama fantasy
yes uther is a hypocritical tyrant on many levels but while his treatment of magical people or even of morgana 's father gorlois are very slow in turning her against him as soon as he declines recognising her as his daughter she immediately tries to kill him	1	adventure drama fantasy
spoiled child 's tantrum much	1	adventure drama fantasy
gaius is this towards merlin	0	adventure drama fantasy
morgana has a definite hand in finally killing uther	1	adventure drama fantasy
actually gwen 's physical appearance may just be one of the least anachronistic aspects of the show her darker skin and curly hair suggest that she is silurian no not that kind of silurian	0	adventure drama fantasy
arthur does this to merlin	0	adventure drama fantasy
also morgana but we all saw this coming	1	adventure drama fantasy
a true love 's kiss from gwen does the job	1	adventure drama fantasy
needless to say she reacted poorly when she tried to use her magic later	1	adventure drama fantasy
also a call back to season 3 when morgana put a doll beneath uther 's bed and made him go crazy	1	adventure drama fantasy
and every promise has been kept or at least it has been hinted that they will	1	adventure drama fantasy
arthur broke his promise to guinevere that her home was hers for life when he banished her from camelot	1	adventure drama fantasy
yes there were mitigating circumstances but the promise was still broken	1	adventure drama fantasy
also who wants to bet that the cup of life in le morte d'arthur is actually the holy grail	1	adventure drama fantasy
we 've now also seen the round table	1	adventure drama fantasy
finally averted in season 4 when arthur hugs merlin in relief on finding him alive after being captured by morgana averted between merlin and gwaine	1	adventure drama fantasy
at the end of le mort d'arthur when gaius comes back to life	1	adventure drama fantasy
the crown for the queen of camelot as worn by morgana and then guinevere is larger and covered in jewels	1	adventure drama fantasy
no matter how many awful things uther does arthur continues to fight for his approval and affection	0	adventure drama fantasy
it 's revealed in series three that the pendragon men have a history of mental illness one which king uther ultimately succumbs to after his illegitimate daughter betrays him and takes the throne	1	adventure drama fantasy
morgause who waltzes into camelot kills five guards enters the great hall challenges arthur to a duel which he accepts then removes her helmet	1	adventure drama fantasy
gwen 's brother elyan surely wo n't be far behind	1	adventure drama fantasy
after arthur had killed a unicorn the keeper of the unicorns tested him on a few occasions to see if he was pure-hearted	0	adventure drama fantasy
the dragon warns merlin about her turning evil and as a result merlin drives her away	1	adventure drama fantasy
merlin 's attempts to prevent the potential future which he has seen in the crystal cave lead to this	1	adventure drama fantasy
morgana 's schemes to break up arthur and gwen only cements their relationship	1	adventure drama fantasy
elena especially when that sidhe was removed from inside her	1	adventure drama fantasy
and the show knows this	0	adventure drama fantasy
why yes we are keeping careful track	0	adventure drama fantasy
proper lady arguably gwen patient gentle devoted to her loved ones but does n't hesitate to take up arms when camelot or someone she cares for is in danger	0	adventure drama fantasy
merlin assumes the spirit wants revenge against the deceased uther and is targeting arthur instead	0	adventure drama fantasy
although arthur does n't know it	0	adventure drama fantasy
it comes true in 3.12 when she temporarily overthrows uther and appoints herself queen	1	adventure drama fantasy
it 's ironic because both morgause morgana and it appears agravaine as well seem to be under the impression that an unacknowledged unmarried bastard daughter could actually take the throne legitimately	1	adventure drama fantasy
morgana also seems a bit pissed that uther never acknowledged her not seeming to realise that declaring her his bastard child would take her massively far down in status as opposed to making her a princess	1	adventure drama fantasy
morgause and morgana simpy plan to kill arthur because they think that with only one child left uther would no choice but no make morgana his crowned heir after all we are shown that it 's not a simple matter of lineage as arthar has to be made official heir that legitimacy is taken away later in the two-parter episode and catrina becomes in turn the designated heir in addition uther reminds arthur that he personally had to win his kingdom not inherit it and thus puts arthur though quite a few ordeals and trials to judge if his son is ready to become king	1	adventure drama fantasy
on the other hand and for added fridge logic if arthur died and uther made morgana his heir the king would probably not even need to officially recognise her as his daughter as the fact she 's been his ward for half her life that she 's had first row seat to how to rule a kingdom and that he dearly loved her would easily explain it to the whole kingdom	1	adventure drama fantasy
so really the whole she 's actually his daughter is not really useful in terms of usurping the throne it 's far more useful to show uther as an hypocrite morgana 's sliding deeper into evil and complicating the whole morgana issue for arthur	1	adventure drama fantasy
percival appears to have this	0	adventure drama fantasy
this is revealed to be a subversion later in the series when we learn that morgana is actually uther 's biological daughter	1	adventure drama fantasy
the whole thing is resolved when nimueh is struck by lightning thus maintaining the balance of life and death	0	adventure drama fantasy
it clocks in at about five minutes when gaius leaves in 1x06 after his place as court physician is usurped by a younger man who naturally turns out to be evil	1	adventure drama fantasy
lancelot du lac has the scene where arthur is rather calmly confronting gwen after catching her kissing lancelot the night before their wedding coldly trying to supply reasons for why she did it	1	adventure drama fantasy
when she fails to come up with a rational coherent answer he just snaps arthur then forgive me	1	adventure drama fantasy
arthur smushing his foot in merlin 's face in the moment of truth was ad-libbed by bradley and colin 's reaction is real	0	adventure drama fantasy
more notably though there is a two-year time skip between seasons 2 and 3 which was at least partially done to facilitate morgana 's off-screen face heel turn	1	adventure drama fantasy
in 2x09 freya suffers the monstrous transformation type with pain bulging muscles and ripping clothes	1	adventure drama fantasy
too many to count of morgana in series three	1	adventure drama fantasy
in the end he died pretending that he had caused the twister to protect merlin and acknowledging that arthur would be a great king	1	adventure drama fantasy
merlin gives freya one of these in 2x09	1	adventure drama fantasy
the only thing keeping merlin from revealing morgana 's villainy in series 3 is the fact that 1 she is the king 's ward and that 2 if the knowledge of him having poisoned her in the past were to be exposed merlin would be executed on the spot	1	adventure drama fantasy
all the knights of the round table would also qualify	0	adventure drama fantasy
does not work	0	adventure drama fantasy
doom magnet with all the stuff going on one has to wonder if it 's merlin or just the whole of camelot that 's attracting it	0	adventure drama fantasy

merlin has no qualms about maiming or killing female enemies with his magic nimeuh sophia mary collins grunhilda morgause morgana	1	adventure drama fantasy
he also remains completely unaware that long before guinevere was his love interest she had a crush on merlin and even kissed him once	0	adventure drama fantasy
he 's doing it to manipulate her	1	adventure drama fantasy
in a heartwarming moment merlin says this to freya	1	adventure drama fantasy
morgause to cenred in such a classic example of this trope that it 's a wonder he did n't see it coming	1	adventure drama fantasy

curiously enough this is n't the first time this sort of thing has happened when seth got involved nikki 's teleportation power was almost impossible to use voluntarily and often activated when she did n't want it to- hence why she sold it to seth when jesus bought the power off seth he was able to use it without any of nikki 's old problems	1	comedy drama fantasy

it turns out to be an if i do not return video made by trudy and it contains all the information monk ever needed to find her killer	1	comedy crime drama
yes that 's right the gun has been sitting loaded on the mantle for 12 years and 8 seasons and has been regularly pointed out by the characters	1	comedy crime drama
monk can often figure out the crime this way before he has any solid evidence and spends the rest of the episode obtaining said evidence	0	comedy crime drama
inverted in that the police did n't mix him up but instead recruited him to make the other criminals think he was the hit-man	0	comedy crime drama

he finally opens trudy 's last christmas gift to him and it ends up being an if i do not return message to him that may ultimately give him the clues he needs to finally solve the mystery of her murder	1	comedy crime drama
although he certainly succeeded in having the grill ignite actually having the fan killed by the explosion was n't nearly as successful as the only real damage he did to the fan was burn his right hand a good subsitute for an ice pack or bandage is to put a rubber foam glove over it	1	comedy crime drama
also unlike most uses of this trope it was n't played for laughs	1	comedy crime drama
it is heavily implied that although trudy 's murder via a bombing did n't cause monk 's issues but it certainly made it a lot worse than before suffering a mental breakdown that forced him into early retirement from the force before the start of the series and necessitated therapy as well as finding trudy 's killer not to mention learning that the car bomb was intended for trudy all along and not a backfired assassination attempt on him that he ever gets better	1	comedy crime drama
he also has relatively minor episodes within the main heroic bsod namely pertained to whether he can get his old job back or not such as when he was not only removed from the case but also had his detective 's license revoked by the commissioner simply because he accidentially deleted a few years worth of forensic files while attempting to eliminate crumbs from the keyboard or when a four-year hiring freeze threatened his chances of reinstatement	1	comedy crime drama
a prior instance of this is where he has a cold case about a valedictorian student being killed by a drunk driver and this combined with monk 's greater skill as a detective left him frequently depressed	0	comedy crime drama
the fact that he was having marital problems stemming from not watching a documentary which turned out to be a chekhov 's gun to finding out the murderer for both their current case and his cold case that forced him to stay with monk did n't help matters much	1	comedy crime drama
to avoid causing problems it was necessary for writers to position natalie during scenes such that her midsection and below is hidden by items like bags tables or car doors	0	comedy crime drama
however when she needs to rescue monk from her old obsessive boyfriend she wards off his advances by stuffing a pillow down her chest	0	comedy crime drama
ironically the host in question had just done an episode relating to monk 's 100th case since coming out of retirement	0	comedy crime drama

monk realizes that the blind witness to the murder of sonny cross was n't really blind when he remembers that she instinctively avoided shaking sottelmeyer 's injured hand even though no one had mentioned that he was injured	0	comedy crime drama
it turns out to be true	0	comedy crime drama
monk himself often is in this trope in mr	1	comedy crime drama
monk goes to the dentist he has a crippling fear of dentists due to a bad experience a fear so severe in fact that he was completely unwilling to go beyond the waiting room while disher and natalie investigate a murder that seemingly happened while disher was getting his appointment regarding a seeming kidnapping of barry bonds and later had to be pried off when he was literally frozen in fear in his seat during the wait presumably from hearing a drill whirring in the background	1	comedy crime drama
turns out he was very much justified in this fear as he ends up being abducted and then tortured by the same dentists in regards to potential clients for the bearer bonds and whether the police had them monitored an incident that also resulted in his fear of them being heightened as a result to the extent that he refuses to go to a dentist even after one of his teeth was chipped	1	comedy crime drama
randy disher was also in this trope in the same episode the dentist one as during the dental procedure for a legitimate toothache and while being placed in novacane he ends up witnessing a brutal confrontation between the dentists and a bald man demanding for barry bonds and that he was worth 13 billion and tried to report it to his co-workers only to be laughed at and/or met with disbelief the fact that he was currently being doped up on novacane when it was happening did not help matters much on his end either eventually being fed up at not being believed and quitting the force	1	comedy crime drama

when it came to main characters the six core noob members golgotha and the justice guild top four were n't part of it and the two other empire players that had been introduced at the time were probably part of the order by the time season 3 started	1	comedy
the fact hence only seemed to contribute to the plot by being the reason fantm could n't form a temporary party for dungeons and had to join the noob guild	1	comedy
however during the empire-coalition war that was the setting for the season 3 finale gaea recognizes a member of the coalition guild that wants to protect her as former empire player who was chatting with the noob guild members right before season 2 's battlefield sequence	1	comedy

and in season 4 fantm not only pressures saphir to let omega zell into justice guild but signs him up into its main roster behind her back under the pretext it gives him the opportunity to pay the noob guild back for its help	1	comedy
on the more subtle end when sparadrap had to make a second avatar in season 2 omega zell started a little exposition speech about how it was impossible to make it join the noob guild in arthon 's absence before seeming to come back to his senses and refusing to help him	0	comedy
in season 3 gaea 's reaction to roxana killing sparadrap 's pets that she was planning to steal and sell off shocked him hinting that he acknolowdged how important they were to their owner	1	comedy
in season 4 sparadrap considered omega zell leaving the guild a bad enough matter to go tell arthon in real life while it looks like he only found out about gaea after kary having exams happened to enable him to join sparadrap for a dungeon	1	comedy
and it would make sense for ystos to just view fantm as an older brother given who his actual one is	1	comedy
omega zell leaving the guild in season 4 that sparadrap considers to be the worse thing that happened since arthon stopped caring for the guild at the time is shown happening while couette is playing joyful music and dancing to celebrate becoming the first member of the guild to reach level 100	1	comedy
and for those who know how the story goes that fact that the game 's creators have been enhancing fantm 's stats behind his back each time he got in enough trouble to put his number one rank at risk	1	comedy
sparadrap takes it up to eleven by caring about npcs and monsters that are acutally meant to be beaten up	0	comedy
the encounters between the two actually loose their running gag status in season 4 when they lead to dark avenger no longer being scary to anyone getting kicked out of the player killer guild and quitting the game	1	comedy

the only time so far that finch has raised his voice was when baby lila was teething on one of reese 's tear gas grenades	1	action crime drama
elias as well when he 's finally revealed	1	action crime drama

though a more realistic example of blatant lies comes in legacy where finch 's nephew comments how he has little skill in computers suggesting finch the man who single-handedly built a giant highly advanced computer and can hack pretty much anything had the same problem	1	action crime drama
the armored car bank robbers in matsya nyaya wore them	0	action crime drama

the first part definitely the second part is still in the air but plausiblethey apparently want to shut down the evil operations of the cia but they are also trying to stop reese	0	action crime drama
those found not to be involved in any sort of criminal conspiracy at that moment lose their boxes after being cleared the white boxes become permanent for that episode if that person is found to be involved in a non-relevant crime fusco and carter also have permanent white boxes probably due to their links to finch and reese when the perpetrator of a crime linked to that week 's poi is attempting to put their final plan into action their box turns red along the corners and center hash marks reese and finch themselves have yellow boxes around them	1	action crime drama
by the end of no good deed the nsa agent has acquired enough information about the machine to get his own yellow box	0	action crime drama
at the tail end of wolf and cub reese picks up his own red box after the machine decides his investigation into finch poses a threat to itself and decides to designate him a traitor to the government	1	action crime drama
as a matter of daily reference on the show though his box continues to display as yellow in subsequent episodes	1	action crime drama
likely because they had both been targeted for termination by the agency and turned against each other in the process	1	action crime drama

elias is the anti-finch	1	action crime drama
but while finch is the atoner and working to make up for his past mistakes elias is a mob boss driven by revenge against those who 've hurt him	1	action crime drama
finch has especially strong tones of this stemming from years of allowing the unimportant numbers slip through the cracks and being unable to protect jessica reese 's love	1	action crime drama
also reese tries to frame the serial rapist for cocaine possession but it ends up not working because he 's got good lawyers	1	action crime drama

you 'll never find us but victim or perpetrator if your number 's up we 'll find you	0	action crime drama
there 's also no guarantee that the violent crime the machine predicts is n't highly justified	1	action crime drama
this is shown when the machine picks elias as a likely victim and when it identifies a potential perpetrator who is planning to kill a stalker who is harassing someone the poi is trying to protect for example	1	action crime drama
the perpetrator-victim twist was reversed when the number of the week was a former construction manager who purchased a rifle and had made threats against a congressman whose budget cuts put him out of work	0	action crime drama
reese aims to prevent him from assassinating the congressman but finds out too late that the poi is being set up as the patsy to the real assassin working for someone else	1	action crime drama
and made really confusing in a case where there were two people using the same name and ssn the actual poi and an identity thief	1	action crime drama
they initially think that the female jordan hardin is the real one and the male is the drug manufacturer/identity thief but it turns out that he 's the victim and he 's trying to steal his identity thief 's identity in an attempt to figure out who stole his life	1	action crime drama

the person whose number who came up in the first episode was the actual villain	1	action crime drama
and then there 's charlie burton aka elias a powerful man who is out for revenge on many people	1	action crime drama
reese is seriously disturbed by saving the latter one and wonders just how many more numbers will appear on the machine because of this mistake	1	action crime drama
by the end of the season there have been eight numbers with a provable direct link to elias since reese saved him four of which elias succeeds in killing	0	action crime drama
in flesh and blood carter kidnaps three mafia dons to keep elias from killing them	1	action crime drama
for example getting a doctor to treat a critically injured reese without reporting the gunshot wounds as required by law by handing over a handbag with six or seven figures worth of cash in it	1	action crime drama

she initially chose lawful until she realised the cia wanted to kill reese then picked good and let reese and finch escape when she had them	1	action crime drama
she faces it again in identity crisis with the fbi asking for help in stopping reese because they think he 's a rogue assassin selling his services to the highest bidder which is a reasonable conclusion given what they know of his recent activities	1	action crime drama
since she warns reese that the fbi is looking for him during flesh and blood it appears she 's choosing to remain good	1	action crime drama
hammered home with l-o-s who was silenced by agent snow after being caught on us soil	1	action crime drama

the fight in the planetarium what with the garbled recordings in the background accompanied by mars from the planets and the flashing colourful lights and all	1	crime drama mystery

a series airing on the wb and later the cw that chronicles clark kent 's adolescence as he comes into his powers and eventually takes on the mantle of superman	0	adventure drama romance
it could be said that the first half of the show from seasons 1 through 5 dealt more with clark figuring out who he was and adding in some teen drama elements while the second half of the show from season 5 onwards was more about clark finding his place in the larger dc universe with recurring guest roles by green arrow the rest of the justice league the justice society and darkseid and the new gods taking place during these seasons	1	adventure drama romance
it could also be said that these later more dc mythos-focused seasons were darker and edgier	1	adventure drama romance
the show is especially notable for introducing the characters chloe sullivan and lionel luthor and for bringing the silver age idea of young clark and lex knowing each other back into prominence	0	adventure drama romance
it does n't help that this rule only applies to clark with his cousin his evil twin and other kryptonians being able to fly from day one which combined with the aforementioned angst makes him come off as weak to some viewers	0	adventure drama romance

the chloe example might not count though	0	adventure drama romance
season 10 's fortune was based on the fact that allison mack was only going to be in five episodes in the finale season chloe 's probably-final appearance so her leaving in this episode was not a surprise	1	adventure drama romance

however there were twists that did come out of nowhere such as connor kent in season 10 and jonathan kent dying in season 5 but do occur if you have seen the right clue	1	adventure drama romance
there were plans to adapt the chloe sullivan character into the official dc superman comics but they could n't come up with the right story or role for her	0	adventure drama romance
looks like they are going to do it after all in an announcement at comic con	0	adventure drama romance
in the early seasons she was rash impulsive and always eager to expose the truth about everything	0	adventure drama romance

the lana clone created just to be killed so she could fake her death	1	adventure drama romance
lex would do practically the same exact thing to fake his death	1	adventure drama romance
come to think of it season 7 in general could have reasonably been given the tagline attack of the clones given that this season features all the clones mentioned above except for the zod clone from season 9 and his army of course plus bizarro for three episodes	1	adventure drama romance
the child clone has survived for now and turned very very evil	1	adventure drama romance
... except now he 's gone through a potential heel face turn as of beacon and according to ... certain spoilers for the episode scion looks like it 's going to stick	1	adventure drama romance
the clone is now revealed to be another way to bring in superboy another dc comics character who had gone through his own share of cloning blues	1	adventure drama romance
he wears black the color he wore as kal-el in the season 4 opener	1	adventure drama romance
it starts in the pilot when he 's strung up as the scarecrow in a very literal crucifixion he gets another in hidden after being shot by gabriel and in salvation after being stabbed by zod with blue kryptonite	1	adventure drama romance
as superman can be seen as a jesus allegory this makes sense	1	adventure drama romance
chloe coined this phrase ironically she later discovers that she herself is a meteor freak and rails against use of the term much to jimmy 's bewilderment he was n't in on this secret yet	1	adventure drama romance
he has a more dedicated nemesis than anybody else on the show a crippling weakness and any number of people who want to capture him to exploit his powers/study the alien	0	adventure drama romance
if you were n't in the comics and your name is n't chloe sullivan you 're probably going to die before all 's said and done	1	adventure drama romance
several of the meteor freaks	0	adventure drama romance
used to a ridiculous grade in finale when tess simply smudges a neurotoxin in lex 's face making him forget everything not just clark-related stuff every single thing that ever happened in his life is completely and instantly erased	1	adventure drama romance
the details are still unclear but as of the season 10 premiere it appears that this is darkseid 's natural form	1	adventure drama romance
chloe she lost the ability later due to a bizarre encounter with brainiac	1	adventure drama romance
the episode warrior turned the in-universe fictional warrior angel into a captainmarvel expy	0	adventure drama romance
a civil-war era photo of a bearded knox which lex shows clark confirms he 's immortal or at least older than he looks	0	adventure drama romance
in later years this would extend to recurring characters and several cases of series regulars whitney fordman jason teague davis bloome and jimmy olsen who 'd be killed off for real might be mourned in the episode they died and then either never mentioned again or mentioned in only the briefest most casual way for plot purposes	1	adventure drama romance
he was at the start of the series and not as the ally he became in the show 's second half	1	adventure drama romance
then again in the finale absolutely all his memory is erased up to and including all his childhood memories rendering this pretty much pointless	1	adventure drama romance
well presumably his personality is still in-tact so he is still the bitter angry cynical bastard we 've all come to know even if he does n't remember why	1	adventure drama romance
although he 's one of the good guys so it 's not really of doom	1	adventure drama romance
the government has recently gone above board with the vigilante registration act and general slade wilson spearheading it although the public is still in the dark about the government constructing concentration camps for the superheroes	1	adventure drama romance

in luthor he has proposed to her and she said yes	1	adventure drama romance
lionel who eventually becomes a father figure for clark	1	adventure drama romance
it was mostly a case of clark redeeming him	1	adventure drama romance
while lionel still had ulterior motives for the most part by season 7 he was genuinely concerned with making sure the world did n't end as a result of lex 's various insane quests and clark was naturally the best means to accomplish this	1	adventure drama romance
in homecoming both brainiac 5 and greg arkin the villain of the second episode of the series who returned to his high school reunion to thank clark for helping him overcome his madness	1	adventure drama romance
lana 's distant ancestor countess isobel also looks just like her	0	adventure drama romance
but then again it was a double length episode	0	adventure drama romance
or just being a megalomanic	0	adventure drama romance
in fact by season eight it 's fully gone though in hex when zatanna granted his deepest wish he lost his powers and his memory of them but chloe was able to snap him out of it	1	adventure drama romance
in season nine it 's even less likely he wants to be normal as he has accepted his destiny to help humanity with his powers	1	adventure drama romance
this could be considered as part of the character growth as a virtual human raised by humans who is on the cusp of fully accepting who and what he is and thus becoming superman	1	adventure drama romance
the show is saturated with these	0	adventure drama romance
also a case of dying to be replaced which is only of humourous interest to people who have read the renamed tropes page	1	adventure drama romance
and they mention that they 've never heard of chloe	1	adventure drama romance

there 's no character on the show who 's not one	0	adventure drama romance
even lex luthor knows that clark kent is kryptonian at this point	1	adventure drama romance
of course it 's anyones guess if she 'll get to remember it	1	adventure drama romance
there is no reason to expect she will spill the beans	1	adventure drama romance
most of the people who have learned clark 's secret are dead their memories wiped or incommunicado in the phantom zone inside some super science device in a coma etc	1	adventure drama romance
some good meteor freaks have learned and kept the secret	1	adventure drama romance
ironically lex would later marry lana and it would be a large factor in the break up of lex and clark 's friendship in addition to lex 's evil deeds	0	adventure drama romance
it 's kind of creepy the way they gush over then-teenage lana/kristin calling her the true magic of the show	0	adventure drama romance
blink and you 'll miss it but in an episode where clark is depowered actually inside a virtual world he leaves the room without lois or anyone else present noticing his disappearance for a few minutes showing that he can actually do this without using super speed	1	adventure drama romance
as of icarus cat has agreed to at least be more objective when it comes to superheroes though whether or not this actually sticks is yet to be seen	1	adventure drama romance
type 0 lois chloe the kents lex lionel tess lana before she gains lex 's super suit type 1 green arrow rick flag deadshot slade wilson or is he	1	adventure drama romance
the vigilante registration act headed by one general slade wilson is a subtle one aimed at marvel 's civil war and dark reign storylines	0	adventure drama romance

then averted with agron who survives blood and sand but is n't revealed to be gay until vengeance	1	animation
spartacus 'battle against good solonius in episode 12 was explicitly designed as an execution	1	animation
she gets the last laugh on lucretia by escaping the massacre at the ludus and having her soldiers seal the doors behind her	0	animation
ilithyia is horrified when she kills licinia in a fit of rage and shows genuine guilt for it	1	animation
he does however apologize to spartacus over lucretia tricking him into sleeping with ilithyia and seems to genuinely mean it	1	animation
he even goes out with a smile knowing that batiatus will be following him soon enough	1	animation
lucretia occasionally doubling as the evil genius	1	animation
now that his cousin lycinia has been horribly murdered he has personal reasons to get involved in the story	1	animation
although the romans did invent the military cut the one spartacus gets would be more accurate	0	animation
she escapes the slave uprising at the ludus and heads back to rome	1	animation
she obviously ca n't escape it forever judging from her last interaction with her husband	1	animation
lucretia lives but as her husband and unborn child are dead she hardly gets off scot-free	1	animation
lucretia was stabbed through her womb but word of god states she will return for season 2 and is thus not dead	1	animation
ashur 's cruelty to pietros after barca is killed	1	animation
ashur again he is allowed to have any of the slaves as his sex slave and he chooses naevia because he knows that she and crixus are in love	1	animation
this was also likely part of a xanatos gambit to get revenge on crixus it works flawlessly	1	animation
the way he goes about getting barca killed is worthy of mention as is his revenge on crixus the gladiator who wounded him in episode 12	1	animation
the scene introducing mira to spartacus bears striking similarity to the introduction of spartacus and varinia in spartacus possibly foreshadowing their future relationship	0	animation
deknight said in commentary for the finale that the only scene he regrets having to cut was after duro 's death	1	animation
apparently agron kills everyone and oenomaus comes to find him surrounded by the bodies of the guards	1	animation
batiatus slimy henchmen aulus who was ordered to kill spartacus wife has one in episode 11 towards the end of the episode he finds himself all alone with spartacus while he questions him about the absence of the supposed wound he received trying to rescue her from alleged attackers while en route to the ludus	1	animation
it makes sense if you have worked out that it is actually ilithyia not lycinia under the mask making both of them victims of a very brutal bed trick	1	animation
of all times and places ashur does this on sura 's funeral	1	animation
widely known as bumbling brother jonathan in the mummy movies he shows a very dark side in the fifth episode	0	animation
a cut spartacus receives in his fight with varro that he does n't get treated results in a wicked infection that nearly kills him	1	animation
episode 13 has this gem batiatus friends	1	animation
we are perfectly safe inside the villa	1	animation
cue the enraged gladiators storming into the villa	1	animation
doctore seems to favor it	0	animation
batiatus begins to break down during the revolt at the end of season 1 when he sees not only his plans for office but his own ludus falling apart	1	animation
lucretia trashes her room after ilithyia demands a night with crixus who until then had been her personal sex toy	1	animation
first by telling him that if he tries to kill batiatus whether he succeeds or not every slave and gladiator in the ludus will be killed	1	animation
when she learns that he did not take his revenge because aurelia is now a slave for batiatus she tears into him even more for the fact that he 'd let everyone except her die	1	animation
spartacus tries to strangle her after he finds out he had sex with her and her own husband headbutts her when he finds out she murdered licinia	1	animation
crixus on the other hand manages to stab lucretia in the gentlest way possible	1	animation
batiatus arranges good solonius murder then sends ashur to warn him	1	animation
if good solonius does n't listen then he dies if he does then ashur gains his trust to exploit later	1	animation
his plan to frame good solonius for the magistrate 's murder however relies on precise timing that would be nearly impossible in an age without clocks	1	animation
melitta falls afoul of this in episode 5	1	animation
the rest of season sees all his joy destroyed as he receives no credit or standing for seemingly impossible victories is forced to withstand various humiliations just because he 's the best is used as a pawn in the brutal chess game between batiatus and tullius and his relationship with his only true friends is poisoned	1	animation
even the finale where he receives much-deserved freedom leaves him adrift with no idea where he should go or what he should do	1	animation
oenomaus will become doctore but will lose his wife and the faith he has to his ludus and never see glory in the arena again	1	animation
affable and cheerful ashur will become a bitter schemer who manages to kill barca	1	animation
good solonius and batiatus will not stay best friends	1	animation
he feels that his father 's patient attitude has held the family fortunes down and episode three makes it very clear that batiatus and his father are not on good terms	0	animation
scene cuts to him dead on the floor at the end of blood and sand gannicus	1	animation
lucretia is quite capable of taking the problem of titus stifling influence into her own hands	1	animation
indeed she is revealed to have been doing so from the very beginning	1	animation
lucretia i 'm not	1	animation
tullius is fond of doing this	0	animation
ironically what they really what revenge for the deaths of titus and melitta are the things tullius is n't guilty of	1	animation
batiatus thought of doing this but was stopped at the last minute by his father 's attempt at reconciliation	1	animation
doctore all but forces oenomaus to kill him	1	animation
ashur was more compassionate even showing grief at having to kill a fellow slave	1	animation
and while impetuous batiatus was at least bothered by some of the actions he took towards forwarding his ambition	1	animation
this almost perfectly describes the frame up from the first season that leads to his death	1	animation
batiatus the big bad of blood and sand for season 1 is front and centre and only a bit less of a vile schemer	1	animation
it works because his enemies are even bigger dicks	1	animation
continuing the trend of blood and sand we have aurelia marcus rhaskos albinius lucius seppius seppia varinius mira ashur oenomeus glaber lucretia and illythia 's newborn baby	1	animation
a recent interview with steven deknight revealed that ilithyia also died	1	animation
she however will have none of it and puts a knife on his crotch and demands he tell her where naevia is	1	animation
turns out that was their plan all along	1	animation
one of the rhines attempts this on naevia	1	animation
it did not end well	1	animation
averted and how with aurelia 's graphic cuts to the face after she is captured	1	animation
it 's worth noting that their bruises come from more domestic fights compared to battlesilythia is hit by her husband while naevia and pietros receive bruises at the hands of their rapists ashur and gnaeus respectively	1	animation
admittedly all four of them die but the black ones do die first	1	animation
averted with oenomaus who is the last of the main characters on spartacus side to die	1	animation
he is the first of the 4 generals to die but he was historically the first to die as well	1	animation
in episode 8 spartacus presents a thin piece of cloth to glaber as proof of ilithyia 's capture perfectly mirroring what glaber did to him at the beginning of blood and sand	1	animation
in episode 9 the house of ashur reminding lucretia and everyone of the house of batiatus	1	animation
in episode 10 at last the roman knows his place before us	1	animation
nearly everyone in the roman upper class is shown to have a case of this	0	animation
spartacus is not terribly happy with crixus and the gauls saving him from glaber 's soldiers	1	animation
crixus later states they were n't there to save him but to stop him from killing glaber as the roman reprisal would be more than they were ready for	1	animation
naevia believing that crixus died so that she could escape and knowing how many others died in the attempt she angrily chastises the rebels for throwing away so much to rescue her	1	animation
after the fall of house batiatus he begins to fight in the pit as a means of punishment	1	animation
glaber kills senator albinius after he 's had enough of albinius mocking him and he 's discovered the conspiracy against him	1	animation
after lucretia tries to put the new and improved ashur in line with insults he calmly explains to her that she owes him a lot	1	animation
and then takes his place as of episode 6	1	animation
he was the one who rescued lucretia and nursed her back to health and is alluded to have done countless other favors and deeds for other gladiators	1	animation
yet he is still seen as someone who is below standing	1	animation
glaber also once he learns that despite his rank no one likes or respects him	0	animation
he appears to be starting to forgive him in episode 9 and acknowledges gannicus as his brother before dying in his arms in episode 10	1	animation
lucretia now remembers nothing of the events of the last few months due to the trauma of what happened at the ludus	1	animation
and in the end spartacus naevia and lucretia take it all in brutal ways	1	animation
lucretia 's natural brown hair has now grown through and reflects her now fragile state	1	animation
agron 's long hair has now been cut completely short to symbolise the level in badass he has taken	1	animation
he hopes this will lead forge a sense of camaraderie between them	0	animation
oenamaus and glaber dying at vesuvius should n't come as a surprise as this is what happened historically the bloodbath among the other main characters on the other hand ...	1	animation
spartacus also tries to do this with mira but it 's too late	1	animation
in the final episode lucretia takes this trope and throws it off a cliff	1	animation
taken up to eleven when later in the same episode she learns how to use it she shoots an arrow between a dueling gannicus and spartacus and hits chadara in the throat	1	animation
though its then immediately subverted when mira reveals she was aiming to wound	1	animation
later he brutally rapes lucretia just to prove he can	1	animation
glaber crucifies one of ilithyia 's slaves despite knowing she is innocent just to show his power and even forces ilithyia to confirm that the slave was a traitor	1	animation
at least it was n't a fucking roman who took my- beheaded	1	animation
in episode 5 while spartacus and agron enter the arena as part of a rescue mira and a team of gladiators set fire to the arena 's foundations causing it to burn and collapse	1	animation
in episode 9 glaber 's forces catapult flaming debris at the rebels base	1	animation
what marcus turns out to be	0	animation
though given the fact she 's a master manipulator with plenty of vengeance to spread around against spartacus crixus ilithyia glaber ... she might be faking her madness her communion with the gods or both	1	animation
at the same time this is of course the worst revenge she could have wrecked on illythia so it still goes both ways	1	animation
unfortunately he is also a leeroy jenkins and dies for it by ashur 's hand	1	animation
he is then replaced by salvius another roman officer while ashur gets promoted to the dragon	1	animation
in the end it turns out that lucretia was practicing obfuscating sanity in her relationship with ilithyia	1	animation
ilithyia gets two in one episode first when she finds out she has to return to capua and second when she finds lucretia still alive in the ludus	1	animation
spartacus gets a rare one when aurelia 's dying and beaten body is dragged out in front of the market by glaber 's soldiers	1	animation
spartacus wants revenge agron wants to fight and crixus wants to find naevia	1	animation
she seems to be the only main character who simply wants to get out of dodge and start a new life while they still can	1	animation
lucretia gets to decide which captive gladiator gets to be tortured to death	1	animation
among her choices were crixus oenomaus rhaskos and a guy we 've never seen or heard from before this episode	1	animation
guess who she picks	1	animation
gannicus has been out of the game for five years and is just as tough as he was in gods of the arena	1	animation
while their lack of watchfulness merely amuses mira and she sends them away to have fun in bed and so she can go strangle someone	1	animation
agron sees rescuing naevia as this	1	animation
strawman had a point seeing as out of the entire group spartacus led to the mines the only four survivors were spartacus mira nassir who almost did n't make it out himself and naevia herself	1	animation
everyone else was killed or captured	1	animation
it 's hard to not feel sorry for seppius as he dies knowing his sister is at the mercy of the man who slaughtered everyone in their household	1	animation

telford is just as bad as his future self and is partly at fault for his own death	0	drama sci-fi
since he was the one who caused it this counts as rush 's crowning moment of awesome so far	1	drama sci-fi
rush though part of the same scene can be excused because he was last seen wearing a desert uniform so his regular clothes would still be on board	0	drama sci-fi
however due to a much larger number of main characters it almost look like an aversion in comparison with previous series	0	drama sci-fi
the issue of the stranded team in human and lost is resolved ten minutes into sabotage by coincidence no less so they can get on with the plot	0	drama sci-fi
as of trial and error a case can be made for destiny itself being this	1	drama sci-fi
unfortunately for her it looks like it probably was n't real	1	drama sci-fi
when one of the aliens in awakening runs into a human it 's the alien that faints	1	drama sci-fi
to make it even funnier the alien faints in front of volker probably the least combative character on the show	1	drama sci-fi

turns out the lucian alliance had tried to make a deal ... which langara rejected out of hand every time to preserve their alliance with earth	1	drama sci-fi
they 're forced to abandon the attempt and ended up using their original bargaining chips for the use of the langaran facility just to return home safely	1	drama sci-fi
can be applied to the second finale due to the whole series ending on the destiny crew going into stasis for anywhere from 3 years to eternity no guarantee that they 'll ever complete destiny 's mission and eli left to fix the last remaining stasis pod or die when the life support shuts down	1	drama sci-fi
she 's also bleeding to death	0	drama sci-fi

telford gets this in the back end of season 2 thanks to being a big damn hero and thus getting stuck on destiny with the rest	1	drama sci-fi
icarus is doubly-ironic considering how destiny is revealed to recharge itself by plunging into stars	1	drama sci-fi

they even beamed tj to the planet from destiny across two galaxies saved her baby created a nebula out of nowhere for scenery during her stay then sent her back while making it look like she never left with only the same nebula beamed in front of the ship as proof it ever happened	1	drama sci-fi
this assuming they are n't on a higher plane of existence since tj 's and the baby 's body was on-board for the whole time	1	drama sci-fi

amanda perry builds a simulation in destiny 's computer so she and rush can actually touch each other	1	drama sci-fi
rush ends up trapped in the simulation because one of the base parameters was the condition that he loves perry as she loves him	1	drama sci-fi
rush insists that the program is simply wrong about his feelings which is where the debatable part comes in	1	drama sci-fi
the first possibility is that rush really does n't love her and thus the trope is averted because destiny not only knows what love is but can measure it	1	drama sci-fi
the second possibility is that rush does love her and thus the computer is inherently incapable of judging this on a case by case basis	1	drama sci-fi
the most likely explanation in this case is that it used perry 's feelings as a baseline and could n't get the same reaction from rush	1	drama sci-fi
pushes telford against the wall future rush you are the coward	0	drama sci-fi
poor eli ... he finally gets the girl but she gets brutally murdered two episodes later	1	drama sci-fi

other major story arcs included the never stable relationship with the cardassians and the dramatic discovery of the dominion a powerful counterpart to the federation found on the other side of the wormhole	0	action adventure drama
similarly the titular ship 's crew in the episode valiant abandon ship in the episode 's climax with the dominion forces destroying many of the lifepods though it 's not clear if this was intentional or just because they were still pummeling the ship into its constituent subatomic particles in a later episode the female founder told her soldiers specifically to let the lifepods escape so that the survivors would spread terror when they retold the story of their defeat	1	action adventure drama
the defiant had to be abandoned a couple times as well notably in the search part i in which odo and kira get to a shuttle while sisko and bashir get to a separate one off-camera though it turns out they actually were captured and the alpha quadrant events of part ii are all taking place in a simulated reality and also in the changing face of evil after the defiant is hit by the breen 's energy-dampening weapon this time the ship is actually destroyed	1	action adventure drama

although damar winn dukat and weyoun 's true death were in the finale	1	action adventure drama
word of god states that the sword does n't actually possess any supernatural attraction it 's just that the glory associated with possessing it was too much for even the most honorable klingon to completely resist	0	action adventure drama
dukat becomes this for quite awhile after ziyal 's death	1	action adventure drama
after the defiant is destroyed four episodes later a near-identical replacement is ready and they even receive a special dispensation to rename it as such	1	action adventure drama
it 's amusingly reminiscent of this trope 's occurrence in beerfest where the new guy asks everyone to call him by the same nickname as the old guy	1	action adventure drama
the finale was this in almost every way from the end of the war thankfully but with billions of casualties and fatalities and almost all the main characters being separated from one another	1	action adventure drama

on the other hand as we later find out bashir is genetically modified and clipping garak was an easy shot for him	1	action adventure drama
so bashir was fully in control of the situation and only made garak think that he was prepared to kill him	1	action adventure drama

when a second crossover finally happens it triggers a full-scale rebellion	0	action adventure drama
example from the begotten doctor bashir to odo you need to relax i told you that last week	0	action adventure drama
during in purgatory 's shadow worf and garak discover that bashir has been replaced by a changeling back on ds9	1	action adventure drama
after the real bashir comments that he can only imagine what his imposter must be up to and worf says they must warn captain sisko before he can carry out his mission we cut back to ds9 where the bashir changeling is delivering a plate of sandwiches to o'brien and dax	1	action adventure drama
in sacrifice of angels commander worf comes through with a fleet of gunships	1	action adventure drama
this is subverted in the episode for the cause in which eddington also sneak-attacks kira however he and the other starfleet security officers were already armed on this occasion	1	action adventure drama
and did it extremely convincingly	1	action adventure drama
quark got this but not from a failure	1	action adventure drama
when he just opened fire on two jem'hadar soldiers killing them and allowing his brother to be saved he stands there shocked that he did something like that	1	action adventure drama
upon realizing that garak blew up a romulan senator 's shuttle sisko barges into his shop to deliver this greeting	1	action adventure drama

humans used to be a lot worse than ferengi	0	action adventure drama

it 's safe to say this is not the first or last time his shapeshifting skills have been used for kinky purposes	0	action adventure drama

when odo protests quark emphasizes his reasoning odo 's along for emergency rations if he dies he 's food	1	action adventure drama
arguably got worse after the truth about his genetic enhancements came to light	1	action adventure drama
this was lampshaded by garak in a time to stand	1	action adventure drama
garak you 're not genetically enhanced -- you 're a "vulcan	1	action adventure drama
multiple times including one ferengi episode but most notably with gowron 's removal	1	action adventure drama

after ziyal 's death dukat is reduced to literally being dragged out of sisko 's office while whimperingly repeating i forgive you ... i forgive you ...	1	action adventure drama
frequently used by cardassian spies including dukat himself	1	action adventure drama
second skin may have served as foreshadowing or inspiration for seska a cardassian agent appearing as a bajoran in the maquis on voyager	1	action adventure drama
which comes to a head in the sixth season finale tears of the prophets where dax stays behind to run the station and gets murdered by gul dukat as a result while kira boards the defiant with the rest of the main characters even jake for the invasion of cardassian space	1	action adventure drama
odo is an expert on changelings and he realizes that the actual changeling is martok not gowron so he also has to be there	1	action adventure drama
but sisko 's inclusion is questionable although he 's a good enough actor to pull it off and he was the one to suggest the mission to starfleet command	1	action adventure drama
the writers considered having benny russell hold up the complete script to the series as the very last scene of the series	0	action adventure drama

additionally a combination of contract issues and simple show fatigue made terry farrell want to move on from the show at the end of season six leading to jadzia getting killed	1	action adventure drama
this is something the head writing and directoral staff did n't even want to do ira stephen behr straight-up said i did n't want to kill jadzia to me that had very little to do with good storytelling but they felt they had little choice	1	action adventure drama
though mainstream bajoran religion portrays the pah-wraiths as always chaotic evil omnicidal maniacs members of the cult of the pah-wraiths who do n't call it a cult obviously believe that the pah-wraiths have been mis-blamed and the prophets are the villains even before bajor 's arch-enemy dukat showed up and took over claiming to be receiving visions and commandments from them	0	action adventure drama

we do n't know this quark supposes that this is the cause but we do n't know how much quark knows about morn 's species etc	0	action adventure drama
thankfully the trill symbiote backstory gave them an out to have the character survive and they got cute plucky then-twentysomething nicole de boer for a replacement who still looked a good bit like the old jadzia however with only one season to develop a wholly new character with she never did mesh quite as well as jadzia did over six seasons a few would even argue she was a bit of a scrappy	0	action adventure drama

near the end of the episode the romulan senator who he presented his forged evidence to has seen through his plan and left in a fury intending to expose the federation treachery to the romulan senate and you think sisko 's misery is because he accidentally caused the romulans to declare war on the federation instead	1	action adventure drama
then we find out that garak assassinated the senator and framed the dominion for it and sisko 's plan has gone perfectly with the romulans declaring war on the dominion ... and that is why sisko is miserable	1	action adventure drama

odo admits he 's never wanted anything more than his respect and for him to think of him more as something to be studied and experimented on in a laboratory	1	action adventure drama
odo also reveals he purposefully imitated mora pol 's hair because he respected him	1	action adventure drama
at least this is one possible character interpretation of him	1	action adventure drama

minister koval insisted to sisko that if marritza was at gallitep the bajoran government wanted him and would have him	1	action adventure drama
gul dukat meanwhile told sisko that if any bajoran hate-mongers get their hands on him i 'll hold you personally responsible	1	action adventure drama
sisko authorized marritza 's release no doubt pissing off koval and then marritza was indeed murdered by a bajoran hate-monger	1	action adventure drama
so what are the consequences	1	action adventure drama
sisko commander launch torpedoes	1	action adventure drama

regarding spoiler not so much a threat from q but more of a reminder that human kind must never stop thinking outside of the box and always work hard to better themselves	1	action adventure mystery
tapestry is a variation in which q shows picard that without the recklessness of his youth and the mistakes he made he would never have learned the balance of caution and courage he needed to become captain and would be stuck in a dead-end job	0	action adventure mystery
this is still enough of an example for fans to nickname the episode it 's picard 's wonderful life	0	action adventure mystery
however it should be noted that the the judge 's ruling is extremely specific that data is not the property of starfleet	1	action adventure mystery
the ruling actually avoids addressing his sentience innate freewill and status as a life form	1	action adventure mystery

it turns out a future version of alexander worf 's son had traveled back in time to stage this attempt so as to motivate the young alexander to become a klingon warrior	1	action adventure mystery
in the episode true q q offers amanda rogers the choice to remain with humans if she can resist the temptation to use the powers of the q. amanda agrees but almost the moment she and picard leave the ready room all hell breaks loose on the planet they 're orbiting endangering the lives of millions of people as well as riker and geordi on the surface	1	action adventure mystery
picard immediately suspects that q had something to do with it but he shrugs and says not this time picard	1	action adventure mystery
of course q 's not only an inveterate liar but he 's also omnipotent	1	action adventure mystery
so even if he did n't have anything to do with it which is dubious he could easily have known that something was about to happen and waiting to offer the choice until that precise moment	1	action adventure mystery
darmok ends up working this way in practice if not in theory	0	action adventure mystery
riker ultimately comes up with a ruse communicated to geordi in code geordi would seemingly arm the slow-witted pakleds with sophisticated weaponry and when the enterprise released harmless plasma through the bussard collectors he would disarm the pakleds weapons claiming that the enterprise 's crimson force field had done it	1	action adventure mystery

his diplomatic immunity is revoked when troi is resuscitated while alkar attempts to bond with someone else and then they beam his intended victim out of his reach	1	action adventure mystery

he deduced that by creating a science fiction show borrowing heavily from the film forbidden planet he could slip in such commentary disguised as metaphors for the various current events	0	sci-fi
this also resulted in attracting multiple high-profile guest stars and guest writers including harlan ellison theodore sturgeon and richard matheson	0	sci-fi
in some ways the show was way ahead of its time in others hopelessly mired in the sixties	0	sci-fi
the show was originally a commercial flop barely managing out three seasons before being officially canceled with a close call on the second season	0	sci-fi

eminiar and vendikar the two warring planets in a taste of armageddon have so theorized their war with each other that they no longer send actual missiles instead they just send computer signals signifying an attack and then have all civilians who happened to be within range of the theoretical attack disintegrate themselves in booths designed for that purpose	1	sci-fi
the leader of eminiar considers kirk a complete monster because he refuses to allow the same thing to happen to the crew of the enterprise when the ship is calculated to have been hit by an attack even more so when he destroys eminiar 's attack computers immediately breaking the stalemate between the two planets	1	sci-fi
computers besides the enterprise 's androids and for the most part the alien races called romulans and klingons except in the fifth film which had one good klingon and the sixth film which portrayed klingons as more varied	1	sci-fi
the series also had several subversions among them the horta who is initially presented and believed to be as the episode title states a devil in the dark but turns out to be a mother protecting her eggs and the romulans who are introduced by launching an unprovoked sneak attack ... but in the same episode the two main romulan characters are examples of my country right or wrong and what a senseless waste of human life	1	sci-fi

the epic snarkfests between mccoy and spock are legendary for a reason	0	sci-fi
however the reason why they invited only kirk to their planet was so they could decrease the planet 's overpopulation by using kirk who had a rare disease in his blood to do it	1	sci-fi
another example is the paradise syndrome where spock hardly eats for weeks while studying the obelisk	0	sci-fi
in the savage curtain surak spock and president lincoln have a hard time understanding the motives and actions of the opposing evil side	0	sci-fi
a piece of the action is the funniest example	0	sci-fi
several one-shot characters die nobly but the undisputed champion and not just for star trek is spock sacrificing himself to save the ship and crew at the end of the second movie	1	sci-fi

also occurs in day of the dove when chekov is ranting about the klingons having murdered his brother piotr	0	sci-fi

do n't leave me please	1	documentary
furthering the alternate character interpretation denise riley stating 'what everyone was thinking qualifies for this if you consider her a complete monster no one in the cabinet is going to sign their children up to be taken by the 456 and if there 's no other choice why not get rid of the underperforming children who are likely to become the 'future drain on society and protect the future leaders	1	documentary

he also admits that they 'kill him just as his role model once said	1	documentary sci-fi
jack also invokes the names of several alien races featured in both doctor who and the sarah jane adventures	1	documentary sci-fi

stuart owens a phicorp bigwig is notable for being rather helpful and non-antagonistic despite qualifying for this	1	documentary sci-fi

the families have shades of this especially when they reveal that they plan to use the new political system the miracle created to take over the world and decide who lives and dies	1	documentary sci-fi
juarez is burnt alive	1	documentary sci-fi
also applies to the legislative process in the show in the space of one conversation you go from hearing that a bunch of reports have been finished and sent to the president and hhs secretary to the recommendations becoming law at midnight that night without even a hint of enabling legislation having been previously passed	0	documentary sci-fi
even though danes is guilty of a very nasty crime the constitution of the united states of america prohibits making an act illegal before the law was put into power which means he ca n't be categorized and sentenced under this new law for an offense he committed before the law was passed	1	documentary sci-fi
also putting folks into the ovens conscious would almost assuredly qualify as cruel and unusual punishment	1	documentary sci-fi
technically the emergency mandate is not an ex post facto law as he was previously sentenced to death and the law is merely changing the administration of his punishment	1	documentary sci-fi
however the show 's misuse of force majeure which is not even invoked in american criminal law should be taken to task	1	documentary sci-fi
it returns to him at the end and rex gains it too	1	documentary sci-fi
rex bites esther 's head off for visiting her sister 's house and being made by a hitman when he visited his dad while they 're in venice beach and could have compromised them as well had esther not already done so	1	documentary sci-fi
since nobody knows what rex did he can continue acting smug towards esther without her realizing his hypocrisy	1	documentary sci-fi
also to be fair rex is trained in that sort of thing and ester is n't	1	documentary sci-fi
visiting her sister also leads a hitman to their new hideout nearly getting jack and gwen killed/would-be-killed	1	documentary sci-fi
then they instituted the category system and things genuinely got a lot worse	1	documentary sci-fi

gwen technically kills her father esther and temporarily jack and rex as the families are quick to point out to her	1	documentary sci-fi
basically what every government in the world utilising overflow camps becomes since category 1 inmates are sent into 'the module death chambers where they are incinerated alive	1	documentary sci-fi
gwen calls one of the camp doctors out on this going so far as to tell her not to call herself a doctor anymore because she does n't deserve it	1	documentary sci-fi
it 's never made clear how three wealthy families were able to attain that much power in the world beyond spending decades insinuating themselves into the top political/financial/media one family for each positions and families in the world and working together on trying to become immortal	0	documentary sci-fi
they 're not even mentioned to be using any alien technology	1	documentary sci-fi
rex is now jack-style immortal a more literal example from shapiro and his cia buddies when they realise the mole is charlotte ... and has left them a package	1	documentary sci-fi
death came back	1	documentary sci-fi
the only cosmetic difference is that rex is the token minority	0	documentary sci-fi

when max actually compliments caroline with no trace of sarcasm and mockery caroline thinks that max must be seriously depressed	0	comedy
