the baby mosasaurs chirp like baby birds while getting attacked by the sharks	1	documentary
even when they go to the bottom to hide they do n't shut up	1	documentary
mostly averted at least by the anhanguera	0	documentary
also note that rhamphorhynchus is thought to have had behaved like modern nocturnal sea birds avoiding thus competition from diurnal pterosaurs that also hunted fish in the same regions thus seeing one far from the open sea and on daylight would not be very common	0	documentary
there are cryolophosaurus sinraptor eoraptor torvosaurus majungasaurus rahonavis miragaia glacialisaurus mamenchisaurus rapetosaurus lusotitan shunosaurus gigantoraptor draconyx cedarosaurus guanlong freakin dinheirosaurus ... but the most interesting examples are the non-dinosaurian saurosuchus anhanguera castorocauda a water-going mammal relative volaticotherium the jurassic flying squirrel probelesodon a non-mammalian cynodont zalambdalestes a small placental mammal ischigualastia a dicynodont inostrancevia a gorgonopsid cretoxyrhina a shark and the by modern standards ungodly large frog beelzebufo	0	documentary

boyd too as he truly cares for echo and her emotional growth into her own being as well as considering the people at the la dollhouse to be his true companions	1	drama mystery sci-fi

hey you see boyd langton papa wolf to the actives father figure to echo seemingly all-around nice and decent guy	1	drama mystery sci-fi
he 's the magnificent bastard head of rossum pulling the strings on everything going on in a massive xanatos gambit that he 's been running since before the first episode of the series	1	drama mystery sci-fi
brain manipulation body hopping	0	drama mystery sci-fi
also the storyline where topher comes up with a way to weaponize the mindwipe technology as far as moral implications of doing so especially when rossum finds out about it forcing topher who is horrified when his blueprints are taken from him by his mother-figure adelle and given to rossum is forced to use the device on boyd when he reveals himself to be the head of the company and who is aware of the apocalyptic implications of the technology and about to kill echo then turning him into a suicide bomber while in his new doll-state	1	drama mystery sci-fi
even the leads are morally compromised ballard 's obsession with the dollhouse leads him to do some morally questionable things while caroline before she became echo was portrayed as a reckless shortsighted activist/terrorist whose obsession with the rossum corporation led to her boyfriend being murdered and her best friend losing the use of her left arm	1	drama mystery sci-fi
he seems to be rather conscience-stricken with regards to her condition once saunders realizes that she is a former doll	1	drama mystery sci-fi
adelle used victor for several romantic engagements and ultimately would have allowed sierra to be permanently given to the man who had put her in the dollhouse as his personal revenge but eventually takes a stand against rossum	1	drama mystery sci-fi
on the other hand rossum and alpha are clearly evil so they could be seen as the black part of the show 's black and gray morality	0	drama mystery sci-fi

when echo shoots harding dead it 's not for the first time he even taunts echo by reminding her his soul will simply be uploaded into more bodies	1	drama mystery sci-fi

saunders confrontation with alpha and her realization that she 's a doll make her noticeably less sweet than before at least initially	1	drama mystery sci-fi
thanks to getting closer and hollow men we know how that 's going to turn out	1	drama mystery sci-fi
enver 's got talent	1	drama mystery sci-fi
this has led to enver gjokaj having a rather large fanbase at least among dollhouse fans	1	drama mystery sci-fi
used in the fight between echo and senator perrin 's wife/handler cindy in the public eye 2x05	1	drama mystery sci-fi
every single move echo makes is taken from fights she 's been in in previous episodes as proved by the constant flashbacks	1	drama mystery sci-fi
also a fridge brilliance demonstration of why composite events are exceedingly dangerous when it happens to someone like alpha being able to instantly access what could potentially amount to many lifetimes of information skills tactics abilities and experience and use it precisely and exactly as need and applied	1	drama mystery sci-fi
topher 's cool slightly annoyed i know what i know vows 2x01 becomes his madness mantra years later in epitaph one 1x13	1	drama mystery sci-fi

nolan kinnard the man behind sierra 's cutie-breaking phase has a minor part in the first-season episode needs but plays a much larger part a season later in belonging	1	drama mystery sci-fi

perrin removing echo 's gps chip is shot uncomfortably like a sex scene	1	drama mystery sci-fi
to a lesser extent anthony killing priya in the attic is shot much like a lovers embrace so much so that it sends anthony into a heroic bsod	1	drama mystery sci-fi
he insists on saving caroline not mellie/november even	1	drama mystery sci-fi
he seems to be bucking for tragic hero status here especially as echo does n't like ballard	1	drama mystery sci-fi
by the series finale everyone has an opportunity to put it all on the line	0	drama mystery sci-fi
mag is in a wheelchair paul is shot dead alpha must leave his new family echo goes through hell aka the attic and grieves paul 's death adelle is on the verge of a breakdown topher has gone through a heroic sacrifice etc	1	drama mystery sci-fi
it 's interesting to note that finally after all these other shows priya and anthony actually do stay together when most of the fandom was just waiting for joss to tear them apart in angsty fashion	1	drama mystery sci-fi
although it should be noted mag may not be in a wheelchair permanently and ballard 's consciousness is uploaded into echo	1	drama mystery sci-fi
but alpha was the one who gave it to her	1	drama mystery sci-fi
nice job breaking it villain	1	drama mystery sci-fi
for a lot of fans the revelation that boyd being the big bad had been moved to fan discontinuity based on his realisticly warm and father like air in season one	1	drama mystery sci-fi
joss comments at comiccon reveal that boyd was never intended to be the traitor until mid season two	1	drama mystery sci-fi
the reason that henry lennix was able to play a lovable giles like figure was because that what he thought he was	1	drama mystery sci-fi
dewitt and dominic 's punishment of doll-rapist hearn probably counts too	1	drama mystery sci-fi
and alpha came up with whatever technique they have for resisting imprinting	1	drama mystery sci-fi
topher could have made sierra into a sex toy for his birthday but did n't	1	drama mystery sci-fi
likewise he makes it quite clear in vows 2x01 that he would never do that to any of the dolls	1	drama mystery sci-fi
in belle chose 2x03 when the dollhouse managers discover the vip they 're trying to wake up from a coma is a potential serial killer and a very disturbing one at that they become much less inclined to wake him up	1	drama mystery sci-fi
lampshaded boyd topher has ethical problems with this	1	drama mystery sci-fi
one could argue that due to black and grey morality everyone on the show is evil in one way or another but no one compares to boyd langton echo 's father figure the head of security dr	1	drama mystery sci-fi
in season 2 they become real guest stars	0	drama mystery sci-fi

it did n't work making them less money since very few advertisers were willing to pay the premium price	0	drama mystery sci-fi
the finale epitaph twothe return comes about ... and the currently more-sane alpha who the epitaphs comics later reinforce has only become less-psychotic because of having non-psycho paul 's imprint in his mind acting as a conscience decides to allow the imprint-wiping original-personality-returning signal to hit him	1	drama mystery sci-fi
remember the reason he was in jail and thus available for doll-ification by rossum is that he was a psychotic killer before the dollhouse got hold of him	1	drama mystery sci-fi
so now not only is alpha back to his original personality he 's also no longer imprisoned or in any way restrained no one knows he is loose or even still alive and he 's about to stand next to a bunch of innocent bystanders who do n't know all those salient details ...	1	drama mystery sci-fi
alpha 's machinations and improbable foresight drove the plot from the second episode	1	drama mystery sci-fi
how the hell did he know they would n't shoot echo in grey hour after he wiped her	1	drama mystery sci-fi

boyd getting himself installed as echo 's handler so he could keep tabs on her	1	drama mystery sci-fi

arlo has a lifetime of criminal experience and knows all the players in the harlan county criminal community really well	1	action crime drama

or rather paralysed	1	adventure drama fantasy
also happened with two early season 3 episodes the glass ballerina and further instructions	0	adventure drama fantasy

when jacob could n't revive his wife or absolve him from all his sins he chose immortality to attempt the latter	1	adventure drama fantasy

kate saved one bullet for the man in black sun calling the old man out when she reveals that she 's bought a controlling interest in his highly corrupt company using her settlement from oceanic she knows exactly what sort of operation he 's running and there will be changes made	1	adventure drama fantasy
unfortunately this is just before she goes back to la and ends up back on the island never to return	1	adventure drama fantasy
jacob does this through hurley to get jack to see the lighthouse mirrors in the lighthouse	1	adventure drama fantasy
end result is that the losties all cram into a tiny space and then activate a bomb that otherwise would n't have gone off	1	adventure drama fantasy
and the first quarter of season three the fallout of the previous finale 's epic kidnapping is ben 's valiant attempt to convince jack to operate on his ailing spine	1	adventure drama fantasy
juliet it appears that the lockeness monster was also becoming the mask after spending so much time in locke form which just goes to show how special locke really was since the monster doubtless has spent at least as much time in christian form and others and never became the mask when imitating personalities like theirs	1	adventure drama fantasy
this was foreshadowed more than once perhaps for the first time when the lockeness monster shouts do n't tell me what i ca n't do	1	adventure drama fantasy
do n't tell me what i ca n't do	1	adventure drama fantasy
and it culminates perhaps during the final fight with jack in which he hesitates for a long moment with the knife to his throat which would make this an extremely rare case of a killed off for real character who is not returning in any literal fashion whatsoever still pulling off a sort of deus ex machina from beyond the grave	1	adventure drama fantasy
and then in season three he finally gets his chance	1	adventure drama fantasy
just ask her mother-in-law who she threatened to have killed if jin were to find out she were alive her father and colleen who she actually shot and killed	1	adventure drama fantasy
jacob later jack then finally hurley and during the epilogue it 's hinted that even walt might become this eventually	1	adventure drama fantasy
the literal translation is dr	0	adventure drama fantasy
in do no harm boone dies and aaron is born	1	adventure drama fantasy
the ending is them in the ultimate sense of being true companions together again in death and moving on together	1	adventure drama fantasy
it 's sad that they 're all dead but it 's happy that they 're together	1	adventure drama fantasy
that said there was only one kill juliet	1	adventure drama fantasy
and even then it was n't the explosion that killed her it was falling down a several-hundred foot deep shaft and being crushed by several tons of steel	1	adventure drama fantasy
desmond was also left behind on the island but it 's inferred that hurley allowed him to go home eventually	1	adventure drama fantasy
pierre chang does this to his wife because pretending to turn into a total asshole to drive her away from the island is the only way to persuade her to leave in time before everyone 's lives become endangered by the incident	1	adventure drama fantasy
when ilana is forcing ben to dig his own grave because she intends to kill him herself he tries to weasel his way out of it by buying off miles 's help	1	adventure drama fantasy
miles asks him why on earth he would need three million dollars from him when there are a couple of jabronis named nikki and paulo whom miles knows about because of his ability to talk to the dead buried alive right over there with eight million dollars worth of diamonds sitting right on top of them	1	adventure drama fantasy
sure enough by the end of the episode he has the diamonds in hand	1	adventure drama fantasy
case in point across the sea the third-to-last episode picks up a thread that had been dangling from the first season namely the skeletons in the cave	1	adventure drama fantasy
similarly the first scene of the pilot had a white tennis shoe dangling from one of the trees in the bamboo thicket jack woke up	1	adventure drama fantasy
given christian was seen wearing the same shoes in the island some fans were sure those shoes meant something	1	adventure drama fantasy
sawyer what 's your problem jumbotron	0	adventure drama fantasy
as of across the sea the rivalry between jacob and the man in black is this but with the condition that neither of them is capable of killing the other himself	1	adventure drama fantasy
so jacob just threw the man in black down a glowing hole instead and let the island kill him	1	adventure drama fantasy
way to create the smoke monster dude	1	adventure drama fantasy
the final season was rife with them	0	adventure drama fantasy
one example is the pan from the season 1 finale of jack and locke peering into the hatch being used again in the series finale when jack and the man in black as locke looked into the heart of the island	1	adventure drama fantasy
there 's the 815 fuselage survivors the tail survivors the others the people from the freighter then when everyone is in the 70 's there 's the dharma initiative and the hostiles the name dharma had for the others	1	adventure drama fantasy
jack does n't enjoy it	0	adventure drama fantasy
jacob and his brother who learn that the woman who they believed to be their mother is n't and they actually come from a group of people who came to the island shortly before they were born	0	adventure drama fantasy
and in season 6 the flashsideways which semantic out though it tried to pull on us about the purely informed or that is to say ostensible trait of its timelessness aside turned out to be just more flashforwards	1	adventure drama fantasy
the first ones being the white and black stones and the infamous numbers	0	adventure drama fantasy
the man in black can lay strong claim to being the show 's ultimate grand master of xanatos speed chess both in terms of effectiveness and speed after the events of the candidate in which on extremely short notice he creates a situation that causes six main characters to unknowingly place themselves in a death trap and also keeps himself clear of his own trap and makes the six think they were double-crossing him when they locked him out	1	adventure drama fantasy
the end result three main characters dead	1	adventure drama fantasy
not bad work considering he only had minutes to plan this all out and build the bomb his trap relied on	1	adventure drama fantasy
by which to kill the man in black helping the mib carry out his own plan the destroy the island all on the assumption that this plan will backfire on the mib	1	adventure drama fantasy
what makes it even ballsier is that jack flat out tells the mib that he 's running this gambit	1	adventure drama fantasy
bad things keep happening to locke 's right leg	0	adventure drama fantasy
another did the same thing but with a person	0	adventure drama fantasy
the first rule is that until his complete heel face turn in season 6 nobody should trust ben	1	adventure drama fantasy
the second rule is that everybody will disregard the first rule	1	adventure drama fantasy
anthony cooper do this for a living	1	adventure drama fantasy
also the much hated nikki and paulo	1	adventure drama fantasy
it proves to be a bit of a stumbling block after his heel face turn	1	adventure drama fantasy
even if he was just another pawn the whole time he still saved several lives and helped countless others	0	adventure drama fantasy
begins with the flaming arrow on the crash survivor 's camp in season 5	0	adventure drama fantasy
it also has its own cosmic keystone	1	adventure drama fantasy
as seen in the series finale the heart of the island contains another cosmic keystone which happens to be a literal keystone	1	adventure drama fantasy
apparently the magic goes away if you pull it out this turns smokey human allowing him to be killed	1	adventure drama fantasy
and then the magic comes back when it 's put back in	1	adventure drama fantasy
there 's the odd soldier or convict okay maybe about a third of the passengers but most of the other castaways are normal middle class people albeit with an awful lot of trauma in their pasts	0	adventure drama fantasy
keamy 's elaborate dead man switch at the end of season 4 should qualify him	1	adventure drama fantasy
can i get me some of that crazy cure	1	adventure drama fantasy
i want answers dammit	1	adventure drama fantasy
well here 's the thing	1	adventure drama fantasy
answers do n't give you everlasting satisfaction	1	adventure drama fantasy
sometimes you need to brace yourself for disappointment	1	adventure drama fantasy
now think about it	1	adventure drama fantasy
you 've been through it all	1	adventure drama fantasy
does it make sense	0	adventure drama fantasy
how come it all ended in a church	1	adventure drama fantasy
except in the finale where he explains the truth of the alternate universe	1	adventure drama fantasy
everyone in the flash-sideways world though it 's clear that they did n't all die at once	1	adventure drama fantasy
jacob was stabbed by ben and cremated by man in black however it does n't stop him from returning as a ghost	1	adventure drama fantasy
keamy sets up one of these before leaving to capture ben linus	0	adventure drama fantasy
sayid makes one with the man in black	1	adventure drama fantasy
shannon after sleeping with sayid and ana lucia after sleeping with sawyer	1	adventure drama fantasy
more like death by romance charlie libby charlotte died when their relationships were finally starting to work out	1	adventure drama fantasy
richard alpert skirts damn close to this in season 6 but is eventually pulled back from the edge by hurley	1	adventure drama fantasy
heck the entire latter half of season 6 especially from the sub explosion to the last episode would probably count as this	1	adventure drama fantasy
it comes to a head when desmond puts out the light at the heart of the island	1	adventure drama fantasy
fortunately it quickly turns around after that when jack discovers that without the light he and the man in black are mortal again	1	adventure drama fantasy
ironically richard tried this earlier and got an ass-kicking for his trouble	1	adventure drama fantasy
there is no 'now in the sideways-verse but hurley and ben especially may have taken a particularly long time to get there	1	adventure drama fantasy
jacob who believes that rousseau was right does n't interfere with the decisions of the people of the island and enables free will	1	adventure drama fantasy
while the man in black who believes that humans are bastards tries to tempt the same people with visions apparitions of the dead and impossible promises that appeal to their deepest desires	1	adventure drama fantasy
eventually inverted in the best way though they might die alone they move on together	1	adventure drama fantasy
and as of 6x16 what they died for this was justified- turns out jacob purposely picked screwed up people to bring to the island so that they 'd have a reason to want to replace him as opposed to someone who was torn from a happy life	1	adventure drama fantasy
people always seem to arrive by accident	0	adventure drama fantasy
it 's never by accident it 's because the island and/or jacob want them to be there	1	adventure drama fantasy
also to a lesser extent jacob summoning people to the island in order to 1 prove that rousseau was right while the man in black 's wager is that humans are bastards and 2 to gather candidates for his role as protector of the island	1	adventure drama fantasy
then in season five it was revealed that it has been jacob versus his enemy all along and now it is jacob 's enemy versus charles widmore and his men who arrived to island on a submarine	1	adventure drama fantasy
depending on character interretation particularly after seeing the events in across the sea jacob versus his nemesis still qualifies	1	adventure drama fantasy
the mobisodes are kinda canon same goes for the orchid video from comic con 2007 but not for the pierre chang video from comic con 2008	0	adventure drama fantasy
everyone not all characters employ this trope to its full definition though	0	adventure drama fantasy
the character richard never ages which we first see in a flashback when ben meets him as a child and richard looks exactly the same	0	adventure drama fantasy
claire does one offscreen sometime after the season 4 finale and sayid is wooed to the dark side by the man in black in sundown 6x06	1	adventure drama fantasy
it 's been strongly hinted that claire and sayid 's turns are the result of being infected by the sickness	1	adventure drama fantasy
man in black you are too late he is wrong	1	adventure drama fantasy
and then totally inverted in the final season the goal of the main characters becomes to stop the big bad from leaving the island something they have attempted themselves for so long early in the series	1	adventure drama fantasy
the other goal for lost is to figure out what the hell is going on	1	adventure drama fantasy
hurley pretends to get kicked out of locke 's group and join jack 's as part of locke 's ruse	0	adventure drama fantasy
early in the candidate jin is talking to sun about having finally seen their daughter in a photo	0	adventure drama fantasy
anthony cooper in the afterlife whom we discover is in a permanent vegetative state due to a plane crash he suffered when trying to teach locke how to fly	1	adventure drama fantasy
it 's more gruesome when we realise that due to this he can never move on	1	adventure drama fantasy
explicitly said to apply to jacob 's brother too	1	adventure drama fantasy
naveen andrews is actually british and does n't speak arabic which is why all of his scenes with people who should be speaking arabic switch to english after one or two sentences	0	adventure drama fantasy
at jin and sun 's wedding jacob tells them their love is special	1	adventure drama fantasy
after he leaves they comment that his korean is excellent	1	adventure drama fantasy
it does n't take a knowledge of korean to notice that this is an informed ability	1	adventure drama fantasy
though rather than being a source of angst he considers this a very good thing since it means he 's no longer immortal	1	adventure drama fantasy
and then immediately played havoc with as hurley 's the one that eventually lands 's jacob 's job with ben becoming his lancer	1	adventure drama fantasy
and then subverted despite being the trope codifier	1	adventure drama fantasy
the flash sideways world turns out to be the afterlife	1	adventure drama fantasy
sawyer and desmond were the other two filmed to be in the coffin but obviously were n't in it when the episode aired	1	adventure drama fantasy
in the dvd bonus material for that season the writers said that they sweated a bit when that episode aired for fear the editor had spliced the wrong bit of footage onto the end of the episode because it would have been a bear to write their way out of	1	adventure drama fantasy
see you in another life brotha is repeated several times and then there are other things of the same sort like nadia 's assurance that she will see sayid again in another life if not this one all of these things foreshadowing the flash-sideways	1	adventure drama fantasy
the poor guy turns out to be a pivotal unwitting pawn in the scheme of the man in black	1	adventure drama fantasy
to be fair now that we know what the sideways timeline really is it 's not clear that radzinsky actually caused the entire incident the atomic bomb dropped down the well probably helped	1	adventure drama fantasy
in jacob 's cave locke is indicated by the number 4 and is the first of the six uncrossed names to be crossed out as he is dead	1	adventure drama fantasy
with a storyline this convoluted that stretches over such a long time period there are naturally a few in-universe examples	0	adventure drama fantasy
sometimes you wonder just how ben could have planned for some things	0	adventure drama fantasy
ben seems like a rookie compared to jacob 's enemy whose plan included everything in ben 's plans plus a couple of twists which ultimately gave him the upper hand and led to un-locke manipulating ben into killing jacob	1	adventure drama fantasy
a promo implies that the man in black turned from a misled young man just trying to get home into the monster because he went insane after spending 2,000 years trapped on the island	1	adventure drama fantasy
while he 's not exactly stealing other peoples bodies the man in black /smoke monster is able to assume the form of anyone who has previously died whose body is on the island such as alex yemi christian and locke	1	adventure drama fantasy
also emily ben 's mother died off-island but young ben saw her ghost in the season three episode the man behind the curtain	1	adventure drama fantasy
however the end of the show seems to vindicate these actions explicitly by saying that even though many died their time on the island was the most important part of their life and they felt it was worth it in the end	1	adventure drama fantasy
the things his followers do in his name range from morally questionable to evil	1	adventure drama fantasy
widmore undoubtedly the man behind the purge of the dharma initiative is unapologetically evil and was the leader of the island for many years before ben staged a coup	1	adventure drama fantasy
it does remain unclear how many of these acts jacob approved of and which were the result of people being tempted by selfishness and their baser nature or possibly under the influence of the mib	1	adventure drama fantasy
most of the main characters recognized their flaws and how their past actions had negative effects on them and wound up redeeming themselves due to the rousseau was right theme which is why they were ultimately rewarded in the afterlife by reuniting and moving on	1	adventure drama fantasy
the irredeemable villains such as man in black and martin keamy who never wished to redeem themselves and just kept getting worse simply got their brutal comeuppances even in the afterlife as seen with the deaths of keamy and his henchmen and anthony cooper being in a vegetative state and unable to move on	1	adventure drama fantasy
desmond in the flash-sideways universe	1	adventure drama fantasy
when abaddon asks if walt has to come back to the island too locke replies that he 's been through enough	1	adventure drama fantasy
jin and sun as well although sun was just about to leave jin before the plane crashed	1	adventure drama fantasy
desmond and penny are definitely this too once they finally get back to each other	1	adventure drama fantasy
subverted in the outside world as jacob seek out kate in her childhood and save her from a problem that would likely have been a important life lesson	0	adventure drama fantasy
and jacob until the incident as regards the monster the show certainly did play with the trope in a nifty way we saw it as far back as the first episode or two but did n't know it because we did n't yet know that it was the same thing taking those other forms like christian shephard 's	1	adventure drama fantasy
although it was n't until the season one finale that we even got a glimpse of its default wispy form	1	adventure drama fantasy
the first antagonist introduced in the series is the smoke monster making its presence known in the first episode	0	adventure drama fantasy
after several seasons of making us guess who the true big bad was we are introduced to an unnamed character referred to as the man in black who was the enemy of jacob and was manipulating everyone even ben the whole time	1	adventure drama fantasy
at the very start of the final season he reveals himself to be the smoke monster thus it was the big bad the whole time	1	adventure drama fantasy
lampshaded in the following episode by hurley and miles and even better it 's implied that jack 's refusal to save ben 's life as a child and sawyer and juliet 's subsequent plea to richard alpert turned him into the magnificent bastard he would become in the future	1	adventure drama fantasy
once some of the characters return home however they realize that they have reasons for returning to the island	0	adventure drama fantasy
jack has something else in mind	1	adventure drama fantasy
candidates are incapable of committing suicide	1	adventure drama fantasy
in fact if tom is to be believed no one who has been to the island can do it at least until the island is finished with them	1	adventure drama fantasy
rose and bernard choose to make a life on the island because it cured rose 's cancer	1	adventure drama fantasy
this is the whole point to locke 's arc jack 's too in a sense	1	adventure drama fantasy
ben also chooses to stay behind in the in between flash-sideways universe rather than move on with everyone else	1	adventure drama fantasy
a massive handling by the remaining a-team and boaties who spent the last few episodes of season 5 formulating and executing a plan that hinged on the small probability that setting off a nuke would prevent the mysterious incident that happened to the swan station	1	adventure drama fantasy
it was n't until five minutes before they were to do it that miles asked what if it did n't prevent it what if it caused it	1	adventure drama fantasy
when the dharma initiative is interrogating sayid he confesses that he is from the future	0	adventure drama fantasy
however it gets more complicated when it turns out that hurley can see and interact with the spirits of the dead meaning that institution dave could very well have been real	0	adventure drama fantasy
the only time someone from the dharma initiative actually managed to shoot someone was when roger linus caught jack and sayid by surprise	1	adventure drama fantasy
widmore 's team in season 6 does n't get a chance to shoot at much that is n't the man in black but they prove themselves to be decent shots in the package	1	adventure drama fantasy
in the candidate they even manage to shoot kate in the shoulder	1	adventure drama fantasy
in live together die alone penny is upset that desmond never wrote to her when he was in prison when in reality he did charles widmore had been intercepting all of his letters to make penny think that desmond had given up on her	0	adventure drama fantasy
chances are aaron ji yeon and little charlie will live to the end as well	1	adventure drama fantasy
partially justified in that sideways is actually purgatory so it does n't need to follow the rules of reality	1	adventure drama fantasy
linus 6x07 after ben reveals that sayid killed dogen and his interpreter ilana are you sure	1	adventure drama fantasy
then a few minutes later after miles reveals that ben killed jacob ilana are you sure	1	adventure drama fantasy
miles he was standing over jacob 's dead body with a bloody dagger so yeah i 'm pretty sure	1	adventure drama fantasy
until then only hurley could see him	1	adventure drama fantasy
he gives up because nobody really wants to leave	0	adventure drama fantasy
also arguably neon genesis evangelion which has a much bigger head start	1	adventure drama fantasy
both shows end with most major mysteries being disregarded in favor of character analysis in purgatory	1	adventure drama fantasy
though he 's still a grand deadpan snarker	0	adventure drama fantasy
in one interview damon and carlton said killing sayid jin and sun was meant to make fans angry at the man in black and remove all suspicions of him not being evil	1	adventure drama fantasy
keamy killing alex in season 4 also counts	1	adventure drama fantasy
the beginning of season 5 saw to it that any survivor of oceanic 815 who was n't in the least bit important was killed by fiery arrows	1	adventure drama fantasy
also happened to the dharma initiative in the man behind the curtain	1	adventure drama fantasy
the candidate includes the deaths of sayid sun jin and a large number of widmore 's employees	1	adventure drama fantasy
the series ends with most major characters united in the afterlife	1	adventure drama fantasy
kate did it to her own father	1	adventure drama fantasy
i guess i overreacted	0	adventure drama fantasy
now or never kiss jack and kate have this in the end	0	adventure drama fantasy
clare does n't name her baby aaron until after he 's born resulting in a whodat reaction from charlie after she uses the name for the first time	0	adventure drama fantasy
show made a great effort of keeping the background cast consistent throughout the years	0	adventure drama fantasy
we eventually learn that claire is jack 's half-sister	1	adventure drama fantasy
in season five faraday 's parents are revealed to be eloise hawking and charles widmore	1	adventure drama fantasy
pierre chang the orientation video guy is miles 's father	1	adventure drama fantasy
and her father believed that she was unaware of her status as this trope until she threatened to stop pretending unless he helped out jin	1	adventure drama fantasy
but in the long run sun 's threat does n't actually help either of them	1	adventure drama fantasy
eloise hawking was so gung-ho into this trope that she shot and killed her own son while she was pregnant with him and yes it makes perfect sense in context	1	adventure drama fantasy
while she did love her son she remained distant from him for his whole life since she knew his destiny was to be killed by her	1	adventure drama fantasy
they actually make it through the whole series	1	adventure drama fantasy
it is implied she and other others survived and scattered into the jungle	1	adventure drama fantasy
his character on the other hand ... he once described how if people see him in public conversation will sometimes drop off suddenly	0	adventure drama fantasy
attempted and failed ... or was it	0	adventure drama fantasy
suffering a lot and eventually dying to save everyone	0	adventure drama fantasy
very obvious in the apartment scene in the life and death of jeremy bentham when locke has his right hand extended in a christlike gesture of benediction and ben kneels down before him	0	adventure drama fantasy
ilana verdansky 's name strongly suggests that she 's an ashkenazi jew or israeli possibly russian-israeli also displaying some badass israeli characteristics	0	adventure drama fantasy
kate a fugitive murderer she had a good reason lecturing locke about love while at the same time refusing to go and help one guy who does love her sawyer and the real mother of her adoptive son claire plus all the other survivors of course	1	adventure drama fantasy
the first episode of the second season starts with one	0	adventure drama fantasy
however ben is not in control indeed he is the leader of this ancient conspiracy but the conspiracy itself is also a front for something else something which ben can not even reach much less control	1	adventure drama fantasy
burn jacob burn	1	adventure drama fantasy
jacob admits that his biggest mistake was turning the man in black into a great honkin smoke monster	0	adventure drama fantasy
but those flashes charlie those flashes they did n't stop	0	adventure drama fantasy
ultimately the most important time of your life was the time you spent with them to paraphrase christian shephard	1	adventure drama fantasy
in the end the mainstream world was revealed to be a stable time loop and the flash sideways was in fact the afterlife all along	1	adventure drama fantasy
they use it on multiple occasions throughout the series and two times one them is accidentally killed when it blows up	0	adventure drama fantasy
and after shannon 's death the scene where an enraged sayid shows off that republican guard hand-to-hand training and just mows through several tailies trying to get to and from the look on his face kill ana-lucia	1	adventure drama fantasy
specific example is mr	1	adventure drama fantasy
eko 's death via tree-smashing or when he responds to richard attempting to talk to him by flinging him into the jungle so hard that if he was n't immortal at the time he 'd probably be dead	1	adventure drama fantasy
ben gets beat up so often and so savagely and by such a varied group of people that they hang lampshades on it	0	adventure drama fantasy
he may in fact be literally nameless his birth mother died before she was able to name him	1	adventure drama fantasy
others include sayid 's basra incident and sawyer 's tampa job	1	adventure drama fantasy
juliet multiple times but particularly in the webisode the envelope after finding out ben has cancer and that her sister may still be dying as in if jacob ca n't sure ben 's cancer then he ca n't cure her sister 's	1	adventure drama fantasy
both stretched credibility charlie moreso	0	adventure drama fantasy
every single dead person who 's been seen on the island including locke has actually been the monster/man in black assuming their form with the exception of the ghosts that only hurley can see	1	adventure drama fantasy
in the season 6 episode recon even the smoke monster admits that he got some mommy issues on his own because she was crazy	1	adventure drama fantasy
later in the season we learn that problems with his adoptive mother ultimately led to him and his twin brother jacob drifting apart and the latter throwing him into the island 's heart transforming him into the smoke monster	1	adventure drama fantasy
as of the series finale the end he has his first gray hair	1	adventure drama fantasy
later in the episode jack locke kate and hurley use the dynamite to blow open the hatch door	1	adventure drama fantasy
he believed that he was making a heroic sacrifice but survived	1	adventure drama fantasy
when sawyer jumps out of the helicopter giving up a chance to get off the island in order to ensure that everyone else on the helicopter can	1	adventure drama fantasy
and takes the bomb that fake locke put in jack 's bag away from the others before it explodes saving everyone in the submarine ... for the moment	1	adventure drama fantasy
after desmond pulls out the island 's cosmic keystone and yes the island 's a cosmic keystone with its own cosmic keystone the island begins to sink	1	adventure drama fantasy
jack after preventing un-locke from getting on his boat goes to put it back in	1	adventure drama fantasy
down in the heart of the island desmond tells him that he jack should let him desmond put the keystone back in since he 's the only one that can survive the em radiation	1	adventure drama fantasy
jack tells desmond to go home to his wife and son and then carries him to the mouth of the cave	1	adventure drama fantasy
jack puts the keystone back in saving the island but taking a fatal dose of radiation in the process	1	adventure drama fantasy
the series ends with jack walking through the jungle until he finally collapses in the bamboo forest with the final shot being a close-up of his eye closing	1	adventure drama fantasy
practically invoked in season 6 's flash-sideways universe given that it was the afterlife	1	adventure drama fantasy
juliet 's a doctor but she 's a fertility doctor she ca n't perform ben 's spinal surgery and she ca n't save colleen from a gunshot wound	1	adventure drama fantasy
she does manage to take out jack 's appendix though with bernard an actual dentist assisting	1	adventure drama fantasy
this is probably because in season four the first eight episodes the only ones completed before the writer 's strike caused hiatus credited harold perrineau jr	1	adventure drama fantasy
so when meet kevin johnson the last episode before the hiatus aired no one was the least bit surprised that michael was kevin johnson did you know that jeff fahey frank lapidus is a main cast member in season 6	1	adventure drama fantasy
neither did the writers apparently	1	adventure drama fantasy
the show 's use of flashbacks flashforwards and flash sideways allowed the writers to dabble in other genres regularly jack 's flashbacks are full-blown medical drama	1	adventure drama fantasy
frequently switch genre	0	adventure drama fantasy
in one episode walt is playing a modern overhead shooter on a modern handheld system like a ds or psp and you hear the sounds of the original pac-man on it	0	adventure drama fantasy
sawyer and juliet in season 5 after jack and kate leave the island	1	adventure drama fantasy
it 's a testament to josh holloway and elizabeth mitchell 's acting ability that they 're able to make their ship rather more appealing than the official couple 's	1	adventure drama fantasy
with juliet he had over 3 years	0	adventure drama fantasy
given the ubiquity of daddy issues on this show very few fathers on lost would go out of their way to protect their children	0	adventure drama fantasy
in season 5 richard alpert does this to eloise hawking when she tries to follow jack and sayid on their way to nuke the swan	1	adventure drama fantasy
yunjin kim sun who gained fame in korea playing action girls	0	adventure drama fantasy
actually exists in-universe anyone chosen/touched by jacob seems to be unable to die until jacob gives the ok	1	adventure drama fantasy
a lot of people show up after death whether by flashback some mind screwy vision or time travel	0	adventure drama fantasy
special mention of course goes to jack 's dad who was already dead before the show started and to the whole dharma crew who were almost all dead twelve years before the beginning	1	adventure drama fantasy
then there 's jack 's and claire 's dad christian whose dead body jack was bringing home on flight 815 but who turned up in numerous episodes throughout all six seasons whether in flashbacks in dreams as a ghost or a dead person impersonation	1	adventure drama fantasy
other such characters would include susan lloyd frank duckett essam tasir tom brennan jae lee yemi angelo busoni kelvin emeka edward burke tricia tanaka howard l. zuckerman roger linus horace goodspeed emily linus jonas whitfield isabella mother and claudia	1	adventure drama fantasy
we discover she 's still alive	0	adventure drama fantasy
the only other dead tailies named are donald and nathan	1	adventure drama fantasy
in the thrid season finale we had plenty of characters who were still alive in the main timeline but were dead by the time of the flashforwards	0	adventure drama fantasy
the first is john locke whose body is in a closed coffin in that third season finale	1	adventure drama fantasy
it 's not till the fourth season finale that the coffin is opened revealing it 's locke and not till midway through the fifth season are we shown how he ended up there	1	adventure drama fantasy
other characters who died during this period include diane of the others greta bonnie ryan price tom friendly mikhail charlie naomi george minktowski regina karl rousseau alex ray captain gault omar keamy michael neil apparently every single remaining survivor of flight 815 who was neither a main character nor an abducted tailie charlotte nadia ishmail bakir mr	1	adventure drama fantasy
so yeah a few people died during this period	1	adventure drama fantasy
examples include stuart radzinsky a character we had heard about as having committed sucide but whom we 'd never seen till now rousseau and her entire expedition and members of the dharma initiative many of whom will be killed in the purge and phil a di member who ends up dying long before the purge as a direct result of the losties actions	1	adventure drama fantasy
the flash-sideways is the afterlife and takes place after everyone shown in it has died	1	adventure drama fantasy
averted with man in black himself i want you to know jack ... you died for nothing	1	adventure drama fantasy
he actually died but much later and with purpose	1	adventure drama fantasy
even moreso once he 's replaced by the man in black	1	adventure drama fantasy
certain members such as ben were allowed to join the others and survive the attack	0	adventure drama fantasy
locke gets an alarming number of these mostly by ben jack and even posthumous ones by the man in black while he 's wearing locke 's skin like a suit	1	adventure drama fantasy
averted with benjamin linus who is redeemed and survives to the end of the series	1	adventure drama fantasy
a lot people thought it would be sawyer due to his character development finally making something of his life and of course having fallen in love with juliet	1	adventure drama fantasy
in the end it was daniel who died but almost nobody guessed that juliet would kick the bucket too thus in a sense killing off the happy version of sawyer	1	adventure drama fantasy
at least until season four and then the red shirts start dropping like flies over the rest of the series..	0	adventure drama fantasy
the series finale however reveals that what was believed to be the alternate timeline was actually the afterlife	0	adventure drama fantasy
they on the other hand hit him with a bus	0	adventure drama fantasy
rose is an example	0	adventure drama fantasy
aaron 's birth in both universes as well as ben 's	1	adventure drama fantasy
jacob expected ben to fail and sure enough ... miles thinks that he failed	1	adventure drama fantasy
this was the man in black 's mo until killing jacob locked him as locke	1	adventure drama fantasy
the smoke monster aka the man in black used this a lot on the main characters he appears to jack as his late father to eko as his late brother to ben as his late daughter to richard as his late wife ... you get the idea	1	adventure drama fantasy
the man in black after killing jacob can only change into john locke when not in smoke form	1	adventure drama fantasy
and in the series finale he 's shapeshifter mode locked into a human being when the island 's keystone is pulled out by desmond allowing him to be killed	1	adventure drama fantasy
in ab aeterno the scene where he makes a deal with a chained and starved richard who at this point has been chained in the ship for several days parallels the one between flagg and a starved and imprisoned lloyd very closely	1	adventure drama fantasy
then again lost seems to have quite a few similarities with the stand which makes sense considering team darlton says the book was influential on the creation of lost	1	adventure drama fantasy
this makes sense seeing as at one point team darlton were gearing up to adapt the books into a movie series before giving it a pass	0	adventure drama fantasy
to the ending of the chronicles of narnia with everyone actually being dead but happily reunited and ready to move on together	1	adventure drama fantasy
the man-in-black to richard good to see you out of those chains	1	adventure drama fantasy
an unusual example in that we the viewers do n't know its been said before when we first hear it	1	adventure drama fantasy
all the time but the series finale in particular where the starring credits went on for about five minutes and spoiled the return of christian among others	1	adventure drama fantasy
well the return of christian 's coffin in the sideways universe was shown very early on so if you were watching the episode without knowing the ending you could have assumed that john terry would appear only as a corpse	0	adventure drama fantasy
sayid attempts to kill ben as a child forcing kate and sawyer to turn over the mortally wounded child to the others with the implication that these events will unalterably set the kid on the path to being the cold hard bastard he is in the present	1	adventure drama fantasy
time travel survival mantra whatever happened happened	0	adventure drama fantasy
also jack 's theory was that detonating an h-bomb on the island would stop the plane from crashing in 2004 thereby somehow magically whisking all the main characters to their pre-crash lives once again	1	adventure drama fantasy
but how would the bomb have been detonated if they never crashed on the island in the first place since the crash survivors are the ones who go back in time to do it	1	adventure drama fantasy
locke 's death is the key to convincing jack that everybody has to go back	1	adventure drama fantasy
also jacob did this as he brought most of the characters to the island so he could find his replacement when the man in black found the loophole he needed to kill him	1	adventure drama fantasy
when he was first introduced he gave the fake name of henry gale same name as dorothy 's uncle someone who actually died on the island after arriving by hot air balloon like how the wizard arrived in oz	0	adventure drama fantasy
they fight crime	1	adventure drama fantasy
rest in peace sun and jin kwon completly averted with the bones in the cave because they belong to jacob 's brother and a woman he killed who pretended to be their mother ultimately everyone at the very end when they all meet up at the church	1	adventure drama fantasy
by the end of the last episode faraday had been killed by his own mother sayid was shot by roger linus though he got better sort of jacob had been knifed to death by ben juliet fell down a pit on the island with everybody else and repeatedly hit an armed h-bomb with a rock and locke was revealed to have been dead the whole time	1	adventure drama fantasy
locke certainly kicked more ass after the crash than before	0	adventure drama fantasy
ultimately the most important time of your life was the time you spent with them to paraphrase christian shephard	1	adventure drama fantasy
yet he 's also the one who gets everyone off the island both times	1	adventure drama fantasy
for every major reveal of the series there 's one of these as well	0	adventure drama fantasy
hurley after sawyer jokes about being able to see hurley 's imaginary friend giving him hope about not being crazy for half a second and then taking it away	1	adventure drama fantasy
after the season 5 finale the apparently deceased john locke probably qualifies as the poster boy of this trope having been manipulated his whole life first by his father then by ben and finally by the entity who has now taken his place	0	adventure drama fantasy
unless jacob 's enemy will turn out to be the good guy after all	1	adventure drama fantasy
note also that ben becomes one of those manipulative bastards who at at the same time being an unwitting pawn himself	1	adventure drama fantasy
he 's a pawn in the greater plan concocted by jacob 's enemy	1	adventure drama fantasy
some viewers read too far into lingering shots of the plane fuselage appearing over the end credits of the finale believing that everyone died in the original plane crash despite a the fuselage area containing various signs that unseen survivors around it have established a beach camp b christian explicitly stating in a long monologue that everything really happened and some of the people in the church died before jack while others died long after and c characters like juliet desmond penny and ben who were not on the plane appearing in and being recognized by the other people in the church	1	adventure drama fantasy
sawyer after he kills anthony cooper and locke when he teleports to africa and breaks that poor poor leg	1	adventure drama fantasy
it now seems that the good the others were working towards was keeping the smoke monster/man in black in check	1	adventure drama fantasy
and working on the lists of candidates for jacob 's replacement	1	adventure drama fantasy
season 6 implies that charles widmore may be this	1	adventure drama fantasy
the following exchange from the series finale jack but ... you 're dead	1	adventure drama fantasy
how are you here	1	adventure drama fantasy
christian how are you here	1	adventure drama fantasy
after jacob 's death he desperately wants to die himself because he thinks his work for jacob was all for nothing but he ca n't	1	adventure drama fantasy
but subverted in the very last episode	1	adventure drama fantasy
when richard learns that he finally ages he tells miles that he now realizes he wants to live after all	1	adventure drama fantasy
across the sea the jacob/mib origin story which has one minute of non-flashback material which is also a flashback to a scene from season one	1	adventure drama fantasy
the flash sideways	0	adventure drama fantasy
kind of ends up being the explanation for the entire show	1	adventure drama fantasy
however in the series finale it is revealed that the alternate reality is really the afterlife and it was n't actually caused by the bomb	1	adventure drama fantasy
so in the end the trope is used consistently	1	adventure drama fantasy
once some of the survivors make it off the island at least jack and hurley end up convinced they should n't have left in the first place	0	adventure drama fantasy
jacob is n't ilana 's biological father but the closest thing she had to a father	1	adventure drama fantasy
nevertheless she did n't kill ben	1	adventure drama fantasy
subverted when sawyer has tom at his mercy	0	adventure drama fantasy
after he surrenders sawyer remembering his capture and threatening of kate as well as his involvement in kidnapping walt shooting sawyer and attempted murder of everybody on the raft takes deliberate aim and kills him	1	adventure drama fantasy
